Pier had never been on The Sunrise street. Many of the most prestigious apartments and villas were located there. He stopped his car in front of one of them.

I would love to live in one of these. And for that he needed a lot of money. With his current job, position and wages, it would take him lifetimes to have enough money to buy one. Detectives with licenses were paid much, but the specialization in which he was an expert placed him at the end of the list. The news didn’t write about him, because his cases were almost always supernatural. That was not something easily sellable. Most people thought that’s some weird clickbait news, instead of a real thing.

He could see it from behind the fence. The mansion was enormous. Pier couldn’t believe that only one family lived there. And what’s more, without any kids.

It was guarded by a private security company. A wooden booth stood next to the gate, and the guard stopped him as Pier approached.

”Yes?” He asked.

”I’m here for lady Jill. I hope she told you about my visit.”

”Oh right,” he looked in the note on the table, “mister Pier?”

”That’s me.”

”Can I see your ID?”

That was something new. He didn’t expect such a request as most of the time oral presentation was more than enough. He swiftly took out his license and showed it to the guard.

”Thank you, sir.”

The guard clicked a button to open the gate.

”May I ask you a few questions?” Pier asked.

”Sure, sir, what do you need?”

“What can you say about Miss Jill and her deceased husband?“

”They were happy as anyone would be with so much money.” The guard smiled wide.

“True, True, but Miss Jill told me that they’d fought over having children. Do you know anything about it?”

“Them? I never saw them fighting at all… not that they allowed anyone near, including me.”

“What do you mean?"

“They hardly invited any friends—I don't think they’d had any.”

That confused Pier. Miss Jill was an extroverted person, so he just couldn't believe that a woman with such a personality didn't have a lot of friends coming over.

“Thank you. I’ll go take a look at the mansion then.”

The residence was an English-style villa with two residential wings. A huge door stood at the end of marbled stairs. A tiny key that he held in his hands looked peculiar compared to what it opened. The door opened with a loud squeak that made him shiver. He chuckled. Even after a long time in that paranormal business, he could still be surprised by such stupid things.

The amount of wood overwhelmed him for a brief moment. He had thought that his office desk was too much oak, but this—was just ridiculous. Stairs, walls, floor, roof, everything was pure wood. He couldn’t even imagine what a spark would do here.

Except for wood, only one thing drew his attention. Above the fireplace on the mantelpiece stood a lone frame with a photo. Happy couple, smiling. He—in the black velvet suit, and her—a blue dress.

The kitchen was clean and he could scarcely believe that someone ever cooked here. If only his office had looked like this, he would be delighted.

He went upstairs to check bedrooms, but similarly to the kitchen, everything was clean as anew. One of the bedrooms had a huge balcony with a table and chairs. That was much better than his dusty window in the office.

Then something caught his eyes. A red roof was glooming from the courtyard. The red roof of the slide. Children slide. Pier rubbed his eyes. But still—The slide was there.
