Another day, another lady to be saved. He did hate Mondays.

But he agreed to the case, so he was looking through the documents he had received from his client.

They always bring me some useless things. With a thud, he threw the file on the table. That was an issue with paranormal cases. Clients showed him only blurry images and called it ‘a shadow’ or ‘a paranormal,’ when usually it was just a play of light and shadow captured.

He always worked alone. He’d tried to work with someone a few times, but most of the time, it was a disaster. His unique ways of leading investigations bothered a lot of potential co-workers.

A kettle whistled, but Pier was lost in his thoughts. This type of ghost usually sought revenge. Even if the clients said that they had a life full of joy and happiness, there was always a thorn stuck deep in the heart. A thing that displeased the dead. It could have been anything: a hidden affair, an unfulfilled promise, or even something as stupid as the wrong decision from the past. The ghost didn't know what was keeping him awake, feeding him with wrath.

He picked up the phone and dialed the grieving widow. The longer Pier thought about it, the more he thought she wasn't grieving or was great at hiding her feelings. Strange, but not uncommon. People dealt with grief in their own way. Maybe stoicism and calm was the lady’s way for that. In the end, she'd talked about her husband well.

“Hello?”

“Hi, yes?”

It occurred to Pier that he'd never asked about her name.

“It's Pier, detective. I've never asked for your name.”

“My name is Jill. Have you investigated my case? The ghost. Can my husband leave in peace?”

Telling them that the files were entirely useless had never been easy for Pier. All the carefully gathered information pieces of the lost ones went straight to the garbage.

“Hopefully, he can. We need to talk first,” said Pier.

It was better to contact a client face-to-face. The materials and an investigation scene have only scraps of information necessary to exterminate a ghost.

They met at the cafe, the closest one to the investigation scene, a young widow's house. She was wearing the red dress now, drinking something from a tall glass. She was talking with someone on the mobile phone when he approached her.

“Need to go. Please do it, as discussed.” She hung up and invited Pier to sit on an empty chair.

“You want something?”

“Maybe a black coffee,” he said and nodded to get a mobile phone “something important?”

“Not really, business as usual. My husband had left me with a lot of obligations.”

“Oh, I see. Official matters can ruin the day.”

Pier took out his note. He liked to have everything written, so that he could glance at it while thinking.

“Jill, we both want to drive that ghost out of your mansion. But without thorough investigation, it’s bound to fail.”

“So, Mr. Pier. What do you want to know?”

”How was your marriage going? Did you have a lot of difficulties along the way?”

Her brew twitched slightly, almost not noticeable.

”We were fine. Well, obviously we had arguments, but we’d always made up.”

“I see. So what were these arguments about?”

“Nothing really important and worth saying. Not doing laundry, not cleaning. This kind of thing.”

Pier wrote everything carefully in his note. Every stutter, every face twitch, every potential lie. This kind of case usually had a second side. Much darker one. If the ghost appeared because of something simple, a relative wouldn't hesitate to reveal it.

“No cheating, domestic violence? Psychologic violence?”

On the last question Jill's brow twitched. It was a barely visible gesture, but Pier wrote that in his note anyway.

“No. Nothing of that sort. Never."

“Alright, do you have kids?"

Next twitch.

"Why does it matter?” Jill asked.

"Everything matters. Every single, even irrelevant, detail can be the reason this ghost is haunting you, miss.”

He needed to admit to himself that his experience in paranormal cases was more than enough to know it.

Jill felt silence for a moment. She drank a few large sips from her drink. Pier saw that it wasn't easy for her.

“We thought about kids," she finally broke the silence, "and argued a lot on that. I wanted to have kids, but he had always said that he wouldn't have time for them. That was true, because he was on business trips every two or three weeks."

Her face saddened and a trace of tears appeared in her eyes.

"I wanted them so badly. Really, detective. I couldn't live without them, even without knowing them. Yet he—he didn't change his mind. That's what we had argued about the most. Rarely, he had gone on a trip not angry.”

“That sounds reasonable to be angry about in the afterlife. But from the other side—he knew about everything. Ghosts stay in this world about things they don’t know about.”

Pier stood up.

“Thank you miss Jill. I think we need to take a look at the scene in question. Do you want to attend with me there, or you prefer to just give me keys to your apartment?”

She hesitated. Pier saw on her face that she really didn’t want to go. Shadows and the second world creatures could frighten people to death, so that wasn’t the improper reaction.

“I’ll go alone. We’ll meet again when I decide it’s necessary,” Pier said.

“Thank you.”
