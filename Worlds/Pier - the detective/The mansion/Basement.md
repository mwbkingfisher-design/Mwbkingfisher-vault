Pier carefully followed cold air that trailed off the ghost. Like before, it moved through the corridor straight for its destination—the basement.

The only problem was that the ghost was translucent and penetrated the door. Pier, however, was stopped by a hardwood. No matter how much he pressed or punched, his efforts left only faint echoes in the corridor.

He put his ear to the door, and for a brief moment, he thought he heard muffled sounds. He had never met a speaking ghost, so the source of the sounds was something different. Jill, perhaps?

An axe could be sharp enough to break through that door. He saw a shed on the way to the villa from the security booth. Sheds usually have axes or sharp tools, so he headed that way.

“Mr. Pier? Are you there?” The guard looked for Pier.

Jill must have informed him, and now he wanted to throw him out from the property. He needed to find a hiding place, or he would be caught easily. An open shed window glared at him, and that was his chance.

A motion on the playground distracted the guard, who decided to go check there. Pier sneaked up to the window. He barely fit through it. Good that I haven't eaten yet. He grinned at that.

The shed was dark and full of things that Pier stumbled over. He couldn’t find any light switch, so he took out his phone and turned on the flashlight. What he saw in the shed made his suspicions not suspicions anymore. On every shelf—and he saw a lot of shelves—there were kids' clothes everywhere, starting with little baby shirts and cute shoes, finishing with something that even a teenager could wear.

Pier froze for a few good moments. Tiny and not only clothes took him aback. Why would there be clothes here? Jill said that they had wanted kids, but they never had them in the end. There was a chance that Pier coincidentally found out Jill’s little secret and the reason why she didn’t want him to continue the investigation.

He wanted to come here later, but for now he needed to get into that basement. The axe was buried in between the clothes, and as he reached for it, he saw one more thing that proved his theories. A photo of a family. It was apparently Jill’s family, except her husband was missing. She, on the other hand, was standing near the playground with a bunch of kids, ranging from a baby held in her arms to a teenage girl standing next to Jill.

Something was off with that playground behind them. One of the rocking horses, which actually was a duck, lay on its side. He was almost sure that when he had seen that place, the hors–duck had been standing in the normal position.

The axe could have been helpful later, but for now he put it back among the clothes. He got out of the shed through the window, as he didn’t want to leave any traces behind, and headed straight to the playground. The security guard was nowhere to be seen—probably back in the booth after seeing no traces of Pier. It wasn’t far away from the playground, so his run was as soft as he could manage it to be. He was on track on something mysterious, and he didn’t want to be thrown out. His self-consciousness would let him go if he did.

“No, Miss, he is not here anymore. Maybe he couldn’t get into the house and left the property… No, you know that CCTV cameras are down. I want to get them fixed but never have the time.”

The guard hung up, but Pier didn’t hear any commotion coming from the booth. After a while, the snores reached his ears. That was his moment, so with the lightest steps he could muster, he headed for the playground and the suspicious duck.

The duck wasn’t particularly interesting. He hadn’t been on playgrounds a lot, but he had seen much prettier ducks. That one also had a weird crevice in the spring. In the photo, the duck had been broken in half in that place. 

He tried to break the duck in half, but it resisted. Pier started looking around the playground for some switch, because such mechanisms had always a handle nearby.

The slide-house was prominent on the photo, so he headed that way first.  It was normal basic house with a slide. The worn red roof loomed over Pier head, and slide metal tube encouraged to go down of it. Yet there was nothing there that caught him eye. The swing wasn't interesting at all. One had railings and the second one was for older kids.

Pier couldn't find anything, so he sat on the swing demotivated. Yes! Sitting! He stood up and straddled the duck. With a loud clang, the duck broke in half, dismounting him.

Pier looked around, but nothing had changed. He took a step and he almost tripped. One of the bricks in the pavement bulged up a bit.

The brick was easy to remove, and underneath Pier found a cable which led in the villa direction.

Still, having in my mind that the guard still had been sleeping, he quietly rushed towards the basement door which, he was almost sure about it, had opened finally. 

The sight he saw upon entering wasn't the one he'd expected. Instead of dark, humid place, he saw bright, hospital lights and he felt fresh air coming from the basement. A laugh was coming from the inside. It was not one laugh; Pier heard two or even more.

Carefully, Pier approached steps. He needed to admit that now the perspective was scarier than if someone had been kept in captivity or dead. Laughing wasn't something you could develop when locked in the basement, unless the mind is already boggled.

The basement was arranged as perfectly fine hotel corridor with multiple rooms on each side.

“Mom?” The voice reached him from one of the opened rooms. 

The girl's head peeked out of the room.

“Hi, my name is Pier, and you?” he tried to gently start the conversation.

“I’m Julianne, mum doesn’t let me speak to strangers. But—” she hesitated, “—you are the first stranger I’ve ever seen here.”

“Are you alright?”

“Yes, my siblings and I have got dinner not long ago. You wanna join?”

“I’m not hungry, I ate an hour ago.”

The girl, although she was a teenager, had a mind of a 4-year-old kid. They seemed to be treated well, but he needed to call help either case, for the kids' sake.

He ran up the stairs only to see that door had closed again. He’d started punching the solid wood, but for no use. The heavy entrance hadn’t even budge.

“I tried that. A lot.” A mature voice came from the foray. “I’m Kate, and you Mister Pier, what are you doing here. She doesn’t let anybody here.”

He assumed that this one was the teenager from the photo, but much more mature. How many years must have passed since that photo? Pier twitched on that thought, but answered Kate.

"She— you must mean Jill, right?”

“Jill…” she pronounced the name slowly as if she tasted it in her mouth. “So that's her real name.”

“You have much different attitude than your sister.” Pier noticed. 

“She is not my real sister— but yea, we differ.  A lot. I was a teenager when she took us. She was just a child, that's why she's more passionate about her.”

"Why didn't you just run away?”

“She's not my sister, but I still care about her. We are like family here, you know.” Her face went slack, and she added, “she threatened me, that if I—we run away, she would find us and make us remember.”

“You could have informed the police.”

“I haven't thought of that,” she said in a lowered voice. 

“I see, it makes sense. I mean you were locked here for years.”

“And now… you're locked here as well,” she said and sat on the stair.

“Truth, but it's not something permanent.”

"What do you mean?”

Pier started touching the wall near the door, looking for something. He was knocking near the handle when an empty sound echoed in the hallway. 

He turned to Kate with cool expression. "If there is a way in, there needs to be a way out.”

“Did you find anything?” A hint of Hope sparked in her voice.

Pier didn't listen to her. He was knocking the wall in the place where an empty sound resounded.

The narrow path lead to Julianne's room.

“Hey, may I come in?” he asked. 

“Sure, you want to play some games?”

“Of course, but let me first check something sweetie.”

At the side of the wall there was a shelf where Julianne stored books and gadgets. The duck standing next to the photo looked exactly the same as the one on the playground.

Pier touched the duck and tried to break it to the his hand. The toy didn't even budge.

“It doesn't work like that,” said Julianne.

“What do you mean?”

“ It's a gift from Jill. We have a tradition that when she is about to leave, she asks me to do something.” After saying that Julianne came back to play with her dollhouse.

“Alright, what is that you do Julianne?” asked Pier.

“Mum told me to not show that to anyone.”

Pier was examining the toy, but nothing come to his mind. On the playground the duck broke only after he sat on it. He tried to put a weight on the duck saddle with his fingers, but nothing happened.

“Not like this,” said Julianne who watched Pier since he had started to touch her toy.

“So—can you show me what should I do?”

“No sorry, I can’t.”

The duck was attached to a shelf permanently, so there was no option of checking its insides. The wire was hidden within the shelf itself.

Pier left the room and gestured to Kate to follow him.

“Do you think you could talk to her and convince her to help us?”

“I can try, but she listens to Jill first. Only then—sometimes—she listens to us.”

Kate took something wrapped in a paper bag from the third room, which Pier didn’t have time to investigate yet.

“Juls, you know what I have here?”

Julianne nodded vigorously and begged, “Yes, yes, please give me a cruncher please.”

“A cruncher?” The curiosity took over Pier.

“Will tell you later.” promised Kate. 

Kate turned to Julianne and said. “This is important. I'll give you one if you promise to help.”

“Can I have two?” she asked with a voice full of hope.

“You know what? You can have even three if you show this to us!”

Julianne took a small doll standing on another shelf, and saddled it on the duck. The moment she placed it there, the toy broke in half mirroring the one on the playground. They heard noise of the door coming from the hallway.

“It worked!” said Kate.

“Yes. Let’s go to freedom!” said Pier and gestured Julianne and Kate to the stars.
