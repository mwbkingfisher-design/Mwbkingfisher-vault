“This doesn’t make sense, Jill.” Pier leaned toward her to see her reaction.

They were sitting in the same cafe as before. The beverages were also the same. Not a lot of people sat outside on rainy days. For more privacy, they decided to sit there. Umbrellas were efficient rain protectors.

Again, as before, Pier scribbled everything in his notebook. Connecting the dots was easier when you had documents full of evidence.

Jill backed off a bit and said hesitantly. “I wanted that slide. I needed at least a taste of how it would be to have a child. Mark couldn’t believe that feeling, and he laughed at me all the time. I hated that—we argued a lot on that.”

“But this playground is used even now. By whom, if you don't have any children? And that basement… could that be connected to your husband's grieving?”

Pier saw that this wasn’t a conversation she had been prepared for. The flinch of her eye told him that much.

“I don't want to talk about this. Not now, not ever. You shouldn't need that to solve that mystery.”

“How may you know that?” asked Pier.

“I. Don't. Want. To. Talk. About. It.” She pronounced every word clearly, loudly, and separately.

So maybe that basement is something more. He scribbled that twice in his notes, as something even more important.

“Miss Jill… I’m doing this only to solve the mystery of your husband's ghost. You need to be honest with me. Otherwise, we can end our investigation here and now.”

He stood up, gave Jill her keys, and headed for the exit.

“Mister Pier…” she started.

“Yes?”

“You forgot your notebook.”

With a firm grip, he took it and ran out of the cafe.

He was moving in circles deep in thought. The tracks on the center of his office room got more prominent with every step. The most important rule of his job said that if the client wanted to close the case—he closed it without any further investigation.

There was something not right about this case and Pier couldn’t let it go so easily.

The way Jill had behaved seemed suspicious to him. People tend to hide something they don't want to expose. He had worked with people for long enough to know their secrets. Jill was anxious about him going to that basement; the things there could expose her secret.

He grabbed the keys and rushed out of his office. It wasn't rush hour, but the traffic was still huge. As he stood in the traffic jam, one of his favorite songs came on the radio: ‘Don't Stop Me Now.’

Nothing could stop him, not before he checked what was inside that mysterious basement.

‘Tonight, I'm gonna have myself.’ He couldn't wait for the fun he was about to have.

When the song finished, he was halfway to the apartment. For the rest, he turned off the radio. He didn't want to change the mood.

***

Before approaching the villa he set up a plan in his head. It should have been easy as long as Jill didn't inform the security about the abandoned deal.

He approached the security booth waiting for someone to stop him.

“Mister Pier. Good evening. Still something to check?” The guard waved at him.

“Yes, one idea struck me in the office. Need to see if it’s true or not. I’ll inform you when I’m about to leave.”

“Sure thing! Let me know if you need anything.”

It meant that Jill hadn’t informed security yet. That could happen any moment, so he needed to be fast. He passed by the smiling guard, smiling in exchange, and moved at a steady pace in the direction of the villa.

The main wooden doors were obstacles that he thought would be easiest to breach.

He had given back the keys to Jill, so he had to find another way into the apartment. Fortunately, the fancy device he discovered recently was an electric lock pick.

He touched the keyhole with it, and with a silent snap, the door unlocked.

Nothing changed since yesterday. If Jill had something to hide, then that was suspicious. She should have thought of him going into the house again. Maybe Jill was so cocky to think that someone would be brave enough to break into her villa.

With the value of the house and the property, Pier was surprised to break into it so easily. The electric lockpicks were a tool easy to get from every shop.

Well… She has her own security guards after all. He considered. Maybe she thought that other security measures would be extravagant.

Pier grinned but didn't bother for too long about it. The couch where he found Jill's husband last time was still there, unscathed. The ghost, like the last time, was floating above the couch like the day before.

“Let’s find out what you want to show us,” he said out loud, and as expected, the ghost didn’t even notice him.
