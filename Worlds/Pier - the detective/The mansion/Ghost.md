He rushed the stairs hopping two steps at once. When he was about to leave the house, he heard wailing. Pier stopped in place to find where that noise was coming from. The ghost was the main reason he was there, and from his experience, looking and being near the shadow helped figure out how, when, and why.

The sound was coming from the living room, so he headed there. The ghost was hovering above the coach. It was just like Pier remembered similar ghosts. Blurry, distorted image of some person—most likely Jill’s dead husband.

He knew that talking to it was useless. They couldn't speak, so the only way to tell anything valuable was by observing its behavior. Pier sat on the couch next to the ghost and waited.

It had been at least half an hour before it moved. Every meter was a distorted, chaotic sway. Pier followed it closely not to lose any movement.

The shade moved to the TV, and seemed to watch it for a bit. Then flew to the kitchen to wash phantom dishes. After that, it stood in the entrance hall looking around. Finally, the ghost gazed on the basement door and disappeared behind them shortly after.

Pier ran to the door to follow the ghost, but the door was closed. A simple, standard entrance into the basement. He had multiple ways to break in there, but with a hesitation he decided against it. Confrontation with Jill about it could give him some answers. He heard faint voices coming from below.

He backed off from the door and the house. The slide, or even more, the playground was still where Pier saw it. Such constructions could have been hallucinations connected to the ghost itself. But this was something solid, real. The slide and the swing looked used recently.

“That's odd," murmured Pier. Lady Jill complained about her husband not wanting the children, yet that slide seemed to be used all the time. Neighborhood kids couldn’t use it unless they jumped over the fence, which was unlikely. The fence was just too high.

His shoe was stuck in the mud around the fence. A lot of shoe prints were going from and into the house. Kids prints.

Deep in thoughts, Pier headed towards the gate.

“Found anything, sir?” asked the guard.

“Not really.” Pier didn’t want to tell him about the ghost. “If they didn’t have any children, do you know why they had the playground?”

“Playground? No way, I’ve never heard of that.”

That piqued Pier’s interest. There was no way that such a big construction could be installed without security’s notice. Even with a tall fence.

“Okay. Thanks,” said Pier and strode off to his car.
