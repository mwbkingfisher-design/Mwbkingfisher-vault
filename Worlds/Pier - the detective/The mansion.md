# Lady

“Heh, you must be really desperate to come to me.”

Pier was looking through the window of his apartment.

“Oh, dirty,” he muttered, barely audible.

“What?” asked the woman who sat on the chair in front of his desk. She was in her thirties.

She wore a white shirt and baggy jeans. The curly hair gave little space to the face. Hmm, that’s not the red-dressed lady I expected, but well… let’s help her.

“Nothing, I was discussing your case with myself. Why did you choose me over all the other detectives? My reviews on Google aren’t too representative.”

“I’ve already been to a lot of different agents, but none of them believed me. Plus, you are much, much cheaper.”

He needed to raise his wages, as his payments were already too small a few years back.

The chair he sat on was comfy, not like the wooden one that woman sat on. He didn't want the clients spending too much time at his office.

He took the documents she brought and looked through them without assessing any of the pictures to not be biased.

“How can I help you then?”

She needed a while to talk. It looked like even talking about this situation was stressful and scary for her.

“There is a ghost. In my apartment. I hate that apartment now. Can you please recognize that monster and help me with it?”

“That’s the problem with all the other detectives. They don’t believe in paranormal things even with proofs visible from the sky.” He got angry at them as he was looking more and more through the photos.

“Please tell me, did your husband die recently?”

Her face was saddened. He knew he was right even without saying that aloud.

“And there it is. Our ghost. Even without a form of him directly, it's his soul that hunts you.”

“But why? He loved me. I loved him too!”

Pier penspun for a bit before answering the woman's obvious, for him, question.

“Even if he loved you, he is hunting you for something bad. The haunted souls only remember the bad things. It’s heartbreaking, but this is how it is.”

She was shocked, as no Google information prepared her for that answer.

“So, what can I do? Will you help me?”

“I can help you, but for now, you need to leave your apartment.”

# The meeting

Another day, another lady to be saved. He did hate Mondays.

But he agreed to the case, so he was looking through the documents he had received from his client.

*They always bring me some useless things.* With a thud, he threw the file on the table. That was an issue with paranormal cases. Clients showed him only blurry images and called it ‘a shadow’ or ‘a paranormal,’ when usually it was just a play of light and shadow captured. 

He always worked alone. He’d tried to work with someone a few times, but most of the time, it was a disaster. His unique ways of leading investigations bothered a lot of potential co-workers. 

A kettle whistled, but Pier was lost in his thoughts. This type of ghost usually sought revenge. Even if the clients said that they had a life full of joy and happiness, there was always a thorn stuck deep in the heart. A thing that displeased the dead. It could have been anything: a hidden affair, an unfulfilled promise, or even something as stupid as the wrong decision from the past. The ghost didn't know what was keeping him awake, feeding him with wrath.

He picked up the phone and dialed the grieving widow. The longer Pier thought about it, the more he thought she wasn't grieving or was great at hiding her feelings. Strange, but not uncommon. People dealt with grief in their own way. Maybe stoicism and calm was the lady’s way for that. In the end, she'd talked about her husband well.

“Hello?”

“Hi, yes?”

It occurred to Pier that he'd never asked about her name.

“It's Pier, detective. I've never asked for your name.”

“My name is Jill. Have you investigated my case? The ghost. Can my husband leave in peace?”

Telling them that the files were entirely useless had never been easy for Pier. All the carefully gathered information pieces of the lost ones went straight to the garbage. 

“Hopefully, he can. We need to talk first,” said Pier.

It was better to contact a client face-to-face. The materials and an investigation scene have only scraps of information necessary to exterminate a ghost. 

They met at the cafe, the closest one to the investigation scene, a young widow's house. She was wearing the red dress now, drinking something from a tall glass. She was talking with someone on the mobile phone when he approached her.

“Need to go. Please do it, as discussed.” She hung up and invited Pier to sit on an empty chair. 

“You want something?”

“Maybe a black coffee,” he said and nodded to get a mobile phone “something important?”

“Not really, business as usual. My husband had left me with a lot of obligations.”

“Oh, I see. Official matters can ruin the day.” 

Pier took out his note. He liked to have everything written, so that he could glance at it while thinking.

“Jill, we both want to drive that ghost out of your mansion. But without thorough investigation, it’s bound to fail.” 

“So, Mr. Pier. What do you want to know?”

”How was your marriage going? Did you have a lot of difficulties along the way?”

Her brew twitched slightly, almost not noticeable.

”We were fine. Well, obviously we had arguments, but we’d always made up.”

“I see. So what were these arguments about?”

“Nothing really important and worth saying. Not doing laundry, not cleaning. This kind of thing.”

Pier wrote everything carefully in his note. Every stutter, every face twitch, every potential lie. This kind of case usually had a second side. Much darker one. If the ghost appeared because of something simple, a relative wouldn't hesitate to reveal it.

“No cheating, domestic violence? Psychologic violence?”

On the last question Jill's brow twitched. It was a barely visible gesture, but Pier wrote that in his note anyway. 

“No. Nothing of that sort. Never." 

“Alright, do you have kids?" 

Next twitch.

"Why does it matter?” Jill asked.

"Everything matters. Every single, even irrelevant, detail can be the reason this ghost is haunting you, miss.”

He needed to admit to himself that his experience in paranormal cases was more than enough to know it.

Jill felt silence for a moment. She drank a few large sips from her drink. Pier saw that it wasn't easy for her.

“We thought about kids," she finally broke the silence, "and argued a lot on that. I wanted to have kids, but he had always said that he wouldn't have time for them. That was true, because he was on business trips every two or three weeks." 

Her face saddened and a trace of tears appeared in her eyes. 

"I wanted them so badly. Really, detective. I couldn't live without them, even without knowing them. Yet he—he didn't change his mind. That's what we had argued about the most. Rarely, he had gone on a trip not angry.”

“That sounds reasonable to be angry about in the afterlife. But from the other side—he knew about everything. Ghosts stay in this world about things they don’t know about.”

Pier stood up.

“Thank you miss Jill. I think we need to take a look at the scene in question. Do you want to attend with me there, or you prefer to just give me keys to your apartment?”

She hesitated. Pier saw on her face that she really didn’t want to go. Shadows and the second world creatures could frighten people to death, so that wasn’t the improper reaction.

“I’ll go alone. We’ll meet again when I decide it’s necessary,” Pier said.

“Thank you.”

# Apartment 
Pier had never been on The Sunrise street. Many of the most prestigious apartments and villas were located there. He stopped his car in front of one of them. 

*I would love to live in one of these.* And for that he needed a lot of money. With his current job, position and wages, it would take him lifetimes to have enough money to buy one. Detectives with licenses were paid much, but the specialization in which he was an expert placed him at the end of the list. The news didn’t write about him, because his cases were almost always supernatural. That was not something easily sellable. Most people thought that’s some weird clickbait news, instead of a real thing.

He could see it from behind the fence. The mansion was enormous. Pier couldn’t believe that only one family lived there. And what’s more, without any kids. 

It was guarded by a private security company. A wooden booth stood next to the gate, and the guard stopped him as Pier approached.

”Yes?” He asked.

”I’m here for lady Jill. I hope she told you about my visit.”

”Oh right,” he looked in the note on the table, “mister Pier?”

”That’s me.”

”Can I see your ID?”

That was something new. He didn’t expect such a request as most of the time oral presentation was more than enough. He swiftly took out his license and showed it to the guard.

”Thank you, sir.”

The guard clicked a button to open the gate.

”May I ask you a few questions?” Pier asked.

”Sure, sir, what do you need?”

“What can you say about Miss Jill and her deceased husband?“

”They were happy as anyone would be with so much money.” The guard smiled wide. 

“True, True, but Miss Jill told me that they’d fought over having children. Do you know anything about it?”

“Them? I never saw them fighting at all… not that they allowed anyone near, including me.”

“What do you mean?" 

“They hardly invited any friends—I don't think they’d had any.”

That confused Pier. Miss Jill was an extroverted person, so he just couldn't believe that a woman with such a personality didn't have a lot of friends coming over. 

“Thank you. I’ll go take a look at the mansion then.”

The residence was an English-style villa with two residential wings. A huge door stood at the end of marbled stairs. A tiny key that he held in his hands looked peculiar compared to what it opened. The door opened with a loud squeak that made him shiver. He chuckled. Even after a long time in that paranormal business, he could still be surprised by such stupid things.

The amount of wood overwhelmed him for a brief moment. He had thought that his office desk was too much oak, but this—was just ridiculous. Stairs, walls, floor, roof, everything was pure wood. He couldn’t even imagine what a spark would do here. 

Except for wood, only one thing drew his attention. Above the fireplace on the mantelpiece stood a lone frame with a photo. Happy couple, smiling. He—in the black velvet suit, and her—a blue dress. 

The kitchen was clean and he could scarcely believe that someone ever cooked here. If only his office had looked like this, he would be delighted. 

He went upstairs to check bedrooms, but similarly to the kitchen, everything was clean as anew. One of the bedrooms had a huge balcony with a table and chairs. That was much better than his dusty window in the office.

Then something caught his eyes. A red roof was glooming from the courtyard. The red roof of the slide. Children slide. Pier rubbed his eyes. But still—The slide was there.

# Encounter
He rushed the stairs hopping two steps at once. When he was about to leave the house, he heard wailing. Pier stopped in place to find where that noise was coming from. The ghost was the main reason he was there, and from his experience, looking and being near the shadow helped figure out how, when, and why.  

The sound was coming from the living room, so he headed there. The ghost was hovering above the coach. It was just like Pier remembered similar ghosts. Blurry, distorted image of some person—most likely Jill’s dead husband.

He knew that talking to it was useless. They couldn't speak, so the only way to tell anything valuable was by observing its behavior. Pier sat on the couch next to the ghost and waited. 

It had been at least half an hour before it moved. Every meter was a distorted, chaotic sway. Pier followed it closely not to lose any movement.

The shade moved to the TV, and seemed to watch it for a bit. Then flew to the kitchen to wash phantom dishes. After that, it stood in the entrance hall looking around. Finally, the ghost gazed on the basement door and disappeared behind them shortly after.

Pier ran to the door to follow the ghost, but the door was closed. A simple, standard entrance into the basement. He had multiple ways to break in there, but with a hesitation he decided against it. Confrontation with Jill about it could give him some answers. He heard faint voices coming from below. 

He backed off from the door and the house. The slide, or even more, the playground was still where Pier saw it. Such constructions could have been hallucinations connected to the ghost itself. But this was something solid, real. The slide and the swing looked used recently.

“That's odd," murmured Pier. Lady Jill complained about her husband not wanting the children, yet that slide seemed to be used all the time. Neighborhood kids couldn’t use it unless they jumped over the fence, which was unlikely. The fence was just too high.

His shoe was stuck in the mud around the fence. A lot of shoe prints were going from and into the house. Kids prints.

Deep in thoughts, Pier headed towards the gate.

“Found anything, sir?” asked the guard.

“Not really.” Pier didn’t want to tell him about the ghost. “If they didn’t have any children, do you know why they had the playground?”

“Playground? No way, I’ve never heard of that.”

That piqued Pier’s interest. There was no way that such a big construction could be installed without security’s notice. Even with a tall fence. 

“Okay. Thanks,” said Pier and strode off to his car.

# Next meeting
 “This doesn’t make sense, Jill.” Pier leaned toward her to see her reaction.

They were sitting in the same cafe as before. The beverages were also the same. Not a lot of people sat outside on rainy days. For more privacy, they decided to sit there. Umbrellas were efficient rain protectors.

Again, as before, Pier scribbled everything in his notebook. Connecting the dots was easier when you had documents full of evidences.

Jill backed off a bit and said hesitantly. “I wanted that slide. I needed at least a taste of how it would be to have a child. Mark couldn’t believe that feeling, and he laughed at me all the time. I hated that—we argued a lot on that.”

“But this playground is used even now. By whom, if you don't have any children? And that basement… could that be connected to your husband's grieving?”

Pier saw that this wasn’t a conversation she had been prepared for. The flinch of her eye told him that much.

“I don't want to talk about this. Not now, not ever. You shouldn't need that to solve that mystery.”

“How may you know that?” asked Pier.

“I. Don't. Want. To. Talk. About. It.” She pronounced every word clearly, loudly, and separately.

*So maybe that basement is something more.* He scribbled that twice in his notes, as something even more important.

“Miss Jill… I’m doing this only to solve the mystery of your husband's ghost. You need to be honest with me. Otherwise, we can end our investigation here and now.”

He stood up, gave Jill her keys, and headed for the exit.

“Mister Pier…” she started.

“Yes?”

“You forgot your notebook.”

With a firm grip, he took it and ran out of the cafe.

# Undercover
## Decision
He was moving in circles deep in thought. The tracks on the center of his office room got more prominent with every step. The most important rule of his job said that if the client wanted to close the case—he closed it without any further investigation. 

There was something not right about this case and Pier couldn’t let it go so easily.

The way Jill had behaved seemed suspicious to him. 
People tend to hide something they don't want to expose. He had worked with people for long enough to know their secrets. Jill was anxious about him going to that basement; the things there could expose her secret. 

He grabbed the keys and rushed out of his office. It wasn't a rushe hour, but the traffic was still huge. As he stood in the traffic jam, one of his favorite songs came on the radio: ‘Don't Stop Me Now.’

Nothing could stop him, not before he checked what was inside that mysterious basement. 

‘Tonight, I'm gonna have myself.’ He couldn't wait for the fun he was about to have. 

When the song finished, he was halfway to the apartment. For the rest, he turned off the radio. He didn't want to change the mood. 
## Breaking into the apartment
Before approaching the villa he set up a plan in his head. It should have been easy as long as Jill didn't inform the security about the abandoned deal.

He approached the security booth waiting for someone to stop him. 

“Mister Pier. Good evening. Still something to check?” The guard waved at him.

“Yes, one idea struck me in the office. Need to see if it’s true or not. I’ll inform you when I’m about to leave.”

“Sure thing! Let me know if you need anything.”

It meant that Jill hadn’t informed security yet. That could happen any moment, so he needed to be fast. He passed by the smiling guard, smiling in exchange, and moved in a steady pace to the villa direction.

The main wooden door were obstacle that he thought would be easiest to breach.

He had given back the keys to Jill, so he had to find another way into the apartment. Fortunately, the fancy device he discovered recently was electric lock-pick.

He touched the keyhole with it, and with a silent snap, the door unlocked.

Nothing changed since yesterday. If Jill had something to hide, then that was suspicious. She should have thought of him going into the house again. Maybe Jill was so cocky to think that someone would be brave enough to break into her villa.

With the value of the house and the property, Pier was surprised to break into it so easily. The electric lock-picks were a tool easy to get from every shop. 

*Well… She has her own security guards after all.* He considered. *Maybe she thought that another security measures would be extravagant.* 

Pier grinned but didn't bother for too long about it. The couch where he found Jill's husband last time, was still there, unscathed. The ghost, like the last time, was floating above the couch like the day before.

“Let’s find out what you want to show us.” he said that out loud, and as expected ghost didn’t even notice him.
## Ghost once again

Pier carefully followed cold air that trailed off the ghost. Like before, it moved through the corridor straight for its destination—the basement. 

The only problem was that the ghost was translucent and penetrated the door. Pier, however, was stopped by a hard wood. No matter how much he pressed or punched, his efforts left only faint echoes in the corridor. 

He put his ear to the door, and for a brief moment, he thought he heard muffled sounds. He had never met a speaking ghost, so the source of sounds was something different. Jill perhaps?

An axe could be sharp enough to break through that door. He saw a shed on the way to the villa from the security both. Sheds usually have axe or sharp tools, so he headed that way.
