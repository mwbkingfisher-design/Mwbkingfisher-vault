"Hmm, She is buying her child a hard roll in a bakery… That's nothing unusual. The old man going out from the electronic store,” mumbled Path, scribbling everything detailed in his notes. “He has a bag with a phone charger…”.

Path was sitting on one of the free benches in the Ink shopping mall. He spent all of his time there. Not because he wanted to, but because he had to. He got involved in something that he still didn’t understand. 

---

Path was in his fifties, and he’d lived in a small cottage near the city’s entrance. Certain circumstances changed where he spent most of his time forever. The cottage was not his home anymore. The Ink Shopping Mall was.

 It was another pointless day of watching TV and reading the newspaper. As usual, Path wanted to do some grocery shopping before the weekend. The Ink Shopping Mall was the closest shop in the Path's neighborhood. It had everything starting from the groceries and ending with electronics and clothes. In front of him, still warm, lay a cup of tea. Too strong for most people, but that's how he liked it. The last sip of the tea and Path was ready to go. He didn't have a garage, so the car was parked, as usual, on the pavement. The car was old, black, and heavily smelling with gasoline during the engine start. That's everything Path could tell about his car. It was never his point of interest. 

The mall was twenty minutes of driving. Path was listening to the radio. The radio station played one of his favorite songs, "Living in a Different World “. He'd been driving mechanically while listening to it. 

“And I'm… in a different world now! And I'm… a different man now!” Nobody heard, so the screaming voice filled the car. He was already in the parking lot of the mall when the song played its last chorus. When the song ended, he turned off the engine and left the car. 

The sun was slowly hiding behind the horizon. The hour was late, and shops soon were about to be closed. On Friday evening, a lot of people wanted to go shopping, and not only that; many were sitting in restaurants, cafes, and just going to the cinema. 

The groceries he bought were his normal shopping like every other week. After paying, he turned to the cashier.

“Thanks.”

The cashier didn't respond. He didn't notice him at all, not even a word of goodbye. It surprised Path more than he thought. Maybe because he knew this boy, and their customer-seller relationship was always rather kind. 

Only a few people were left in the mall. Path's watch showed ten minutes before an eight, and that was a time when the stores were closing themselves. 

When he tried to leave the shopping mall, some force stopped him from doing so. It felt like an invisible non-penetrable wall.

“What the …” Path’s voice was surprised, but no one seemed to notice him. 

He tried to talk to somebody, but nobody answered any of his questions. Finally, he noticed a security guard chilling before one of the stores. He was looking at expensive suits on display, and probably wearing these in his mind.

“Hey, excuse me, can you help me, please?” asked Path to the big guard. But the man didn't react to any of his words. He was still gazing into the shop window. 

Path tried to reach his arm to get his attention, but his hand went just through the guard. His hands started to tremble after the shock. 

“What's going on,” said Path, but nobody answered him. 

More and more people were leaving the mall until the last person who stayed was the suit-passionate security guard. Even he left the building not long after. Path stayed in the mall alone, with no lights, and no people. Nobody was doing the shopping, sitting in cafes, or going to the cinema. 

He had thought that it was okay. That tomorrow the mall would be open again, but then he recalled his ghost appearance. Nobody was able to hear him, nor was he able to touch anyone. Path felt anxiety and fear. His neck started to sweat. There was no real explanation of what was going on here. 

The decision to sit down and calm himself was a good decision. The groceries were lying next to his feet,  and the machinery in his brain started to work. 

Breaking the windows and fleeing could be an option, but the invisible barrier that had stopped him before could work again. The Mall bound him in this place alone. He took his face into his hands and started to sob. Maybe death found the way to him, and this was how life wanted to communicate that. Bound in a place where he didn't spend too much time.

“Is this a freaking joke? I don't even like the malls!” Echo of his shout was bouncing through an empty hall. There was no one in there to hear it. Path still had the hope that someone would be able to hear him once again someday. He looked at his semi-transparent hand. He could consider it funny, seeing his boots through his hands. But now he didn’t laugh.

Maybe this was fate for him? Maybe that was how the world wanted to penalize him for all the chances he missed or ignored. 

A sudden noise from the other side of the mall returned his thoughts to reality. Maybe he wasn't all alone in this strange situation. He rushed to the source of the noise, but the closer he was, the weirder the sound became. Horses and clanging of metal were the noises that Path was expecting the least. In the front of the DIY store, two knights fought. His mouth was half open, but he had to admit that it looked spectacular. 

He hid to not be noticed by these fighting warriors. The last thing he would like now was to be killed, or killed a second time since he was a ghost, by enraged fighters. 

“Someone is here!” A distant voice came from behind him. Path just knew that this ‘someone’ was him. He looked around and saw a person dressed in black pointing a finger at him. 

Both knights simultaneously turned their faces in his direction.

“Get him,” said one of the knights, “now!”

All of the strangers sprinted after him. Without any afterthoughts, Path ran as fast as he could. His mind was working in the highest gear, thinking about any of the places in which he could hide from the eyes of the attackers. Various shops that he passed weren't any defense or hiding place. Through the glasses, all the inside of the shops could be seen. Additionally, most of them were closed, not to be opened without any key. 

He almost circled all the way to the place where the chase had begun. He stopped to get a breath, with a realization that he was standing in the place where the knight fought. There, he saw something unusual. Massive painting that was hanging normally on the wall high above, was now standing on the floor. The view shown on it was astounding, starting with a forest in the valley and ending on mountains far in the background. Assuming that the painter was painting what was before him, then he was standing on a high mountain cliff. 

The thing that distinguished this painting from many others hanging in this mall was the realistic feeling it gave. It almost felt like Path could put the arm inside and go through it. He tried, and he really could go into the world inside the painting. Hearing chasing voices, he entered the world behind the painting without any more hesitation. Path regretted it a few moments later when he was falling off the cliff. The painting was much closer to the edge than he expected. 

The ground was a few kilometers away and Path didn't have any ideas how to overcome this situation. It wasn't far away from the land when he suddenly felt something soft instead of what he was expecting, bone bone-breaking crash with the soil. He looked around himself, just to be surprised by the view of the pillows scattered around him.

“We were waiting for you young fellow.” A harsh voice came from above. Path squinted his eyes hard, and only then he was able to recognize that the figure standing there was actually a human. But if that was a man or woman; that was a lot harder to tell because of the sun shining directly on him. 

“Who are... where am… young?” The last word filled the air for a moment. Immediately after, he looked at his hands. These weren't his hands anymore, but some boy's instead. He touched his face and didn't feel normal wrinkles around it. 

“Why so surprised? You don't look too old for me,” said the voice. 

Until Path covered his eyes with the palm of his hand, he wasn't able to look the person in the face. She was a woman in her thirties, wearing the weirdest outfit he'd ever seen. The mail on her chest was shining in the full sun, in contrast with the military beret. Long leather boots looked like they were taken directly from the wild beasts in the forest and sewn at a quick pace. She had daggers attached to her belt and a big rifle on her back. 

A lot of her comrades, who were working behind, looked similar but much less stunning. 

Path tried to stand, but it wasn't easy after falling from the cliff. The officer, as he assumed, gave him a helping hand. After struggling for a few seconds, he was finally on his feet, being able to see what he was traveling in. A giant ship made of rock, floating a few hundred meters above the ground. The deck looked like it was sculpted by some fine artist, with details that Path would never even think about. It was impressive, but the most alluring thing on the deck was the captain's wheel. Instead of being wooden, as a normal wheel would be, or the rock like the rest of the ship, it was made from shiny blue material that resembled topaz or diamond. The strange aura was emitting from it as visible particles, looking like a swarm of bees.

“Don't look at it like this. Try something and you will regret that you have hands. Every one of my comrades will spot that you are trying to take something, and they will cut them off without mercy. I'm Burney and welcome on Cid, the one and only,  greatest ship in the world that brings joy and happiness, fighting unfairness and evil.“ Burney interrupted his nosiness.

“How did you know I will be here? “ asked Path one of the questions that bothered him the most. The fact he was falling at some random time from the cliff, and they were able to catch him was suspicious. 

“We have our ways of knowing things. But I can't tell you now. Comrades… Let's move.”

“But, where are we going?” Path was scared, but at the same time, he liked the fact that he would be able to explore this fascinating world.

“We are going to Iharas, the hiding spot of our rebellion.”

“Rebellion? What do you mean by that?” 

“We are fighting against the king. The kingdom is breaking into pieces during the time of this ruling. We want to change it actively in every possible way.”

“And what do I have to do with all of this?”

“I won't tell you now. Can't. Our leader will tell you more when we arrive at Iharas.” said Burney. “And for now, Clark will show you where you will spend the journey. Please don't wander around alone.”

A big man with a scar on the right side of his face muttered something to Path. Through his actions, Path deducted that the big man wanted him to follow. As he was not in a position to object, he did as instructed.

***kajuta was a small room, whole in rocks like the rest of the ship. The bed wasn't even a bed, but a plain rock ***oszlifowany. Only one small window was showing outside. Path could say that they were flying, by the view of clouds passing by. Except for them, he couldn't see anything. 

When he sat on the rocky bed, he'd finally got time to think through the situation. He was alone in some other world or dimension, kept as a slave. They knew he would appear there. The more Path was thinking about it the more he found the situation unexplainable. 

Escaping was one option, but only a short while was enough to throw away this plan. He was high above the sky and, what's more, he was old enough not to even try such maneuvers. Sudden thought appeared in his mind. The officer was referring to him as a ‘young boy’, but he knew that his best times were already gone. The only glass-like thing in the room was the small window looking at the clouds. Path looked at the reflection only to see a young man looking at him with brown eyes.

“Is… that me?” Path couldn't believe it even after looking at the window for a third time. He was feeling much stronger and vigorous, but he thought it was adrenaline running in his veins.

Maybe as a young boy I have some chance, thought Path. No… There are too many people on the ship to try anything. 

After analyzing many options, he chose that the best one is to stay in his room and wait for what to happen. If they'd want to hurt him, he would be dead already. 

---

The journey lasted for some time. Only voices he heard were coming from the deck and from the guy with a scar who was bringing him the food. It was nothing special. Mostly porridge and water, which tasted really good. Everything was good for a hungry man, so Path wasn't complaining. 

He was sleeping really bad almost every night of the flight. The rocky bed was awful to sleep on, as the back and the neck were screaming for help. The view he saw in a few days was worth all these sleeping troubles. Magnificent mountains with a sun setting behind them. On top of these Path could see building-like structures carved in rock. A lot of tiny silhouettes were hanging around there. The view reminded him of medieval towns he saw in the books during his highschool. And yet, it was far more advanced than them. Many of the buildings had massive metal additions, which were adding a futuristic look to the town. After a closer look, he saw posts with people inside holding their weapons. Path couldn't see exactly, but guns looked like the one that Burney was holding. 

The airport next to the town was giant and impressive. Multiple big air ships, not as magnificent as Cid, were floating lifelessly. All of them were made out of rock and long giant barrels were sticking out from windows on the bottom of ships.

He started to hear the noise of the town when the door slammed. The man with a scar was standing in the door looking at Path suspiciously. The muttering he made didn't give Path a clue what he wanted from him. It was a wave of a hand that cleared it for him. The man wanted him to leave the room. With the last glance on the airport, Path noticed that previously freezed ships were coming back to life.

Burney was almost the last person on the ship. 

“How was your journey,” She asked. 

“It was lockingly weird… but more convenient than I thought,” answered Path seriously.“

“Good, welcome to Iharias, the city of rocks.” Burney waved hands vigorously presenting the city with an officer manner. “We will now go to the rebel council. There you will find the answers you seek.”

She moved to the land through the board that connected it with a ship. With a glance, she waited on Clark and Path to come. Clark nonchalantly moved through the board, but Path was afraid. There was nothing really connecting the board to either ship or the land. He could clearly see the ground all the way down. Falling from such height would probably leave a bloody mass, not a corpse.  The Stares of both his companions were getting heavy. He tried the board with one leg just to notice that it was balancing a little. 

“Did someone fall from this board?” asked Path suspiciously. 

“Yes, there were a few comrades that fell down and never came back.” No hesitance was heard in Burney's voice. 

Clark muttered something. Path didn't know if the scar man was trying to say something or if it was laughter coming from his mouth. Path decided to go, but he didn't close his eyes. Instead, he preferred to lock his gaze in Burney.

The docks were really a mess. Random pieces of rocks and scraps of metal lay anywhere. And there were a lot of people; Path saw different kinds everywhere, soldiers mixing with normal workers who were moving the boxes from the ship they were on. As they were going through that place, many soldiers were approaching Burney with some information or questions. Without any emotions she answered everything. Path couldn’t see even a flinch of a hesitation from her. 

He could smell steel everywhere, and the sound of smiths was overwhelming.

During their walk, Path occasionally could see a tunnel going down inside the mountain. Many people were going into it, which caught his attention.

“What is that?” asked Path, showing the tunnel with his fingers.

“These are entrances to the city.” explained Burney.

“Entrances… city… isn't this already a city itself?”

“No. It's going deep inside the mountain. Actually, the council's chamber is in the deepest point of that mountain.” Burney looked at some of the entrances and with an afterthought she said. “Hmm, I think this one will be the fastest way to the chambers.” She went with her vigorous style heading to one of the entrances.

Before the stairs two guards held the watch. This was the only entrance with such precautions.

When they approached the guards, they only moved quickly to the side and gestured for them to enter. Burney was behaving in the way she was a really important person. Path didn't notice the politeness or submission of people against her as he was busy wondering about the city. So many entrances would mean that beneath his feet there was a huge city. 

Clark growled at the guards and Path could see the whimper that guard made. Emerging into the entrance, Path could only hear distant conversation.

“This damn right hand of an officer. I hate him.”

“Yea, I get what you mean.”

The corridor was really dark. Flickering lights were visible from time to time. Steps were not helping as they were steps enough to fall on your face and break something more than just a leg. Path could also feel the warmth of the inside. On the top of the mountain constant wind was making him chilly. But here, that didn't apply. If not for the situation he was in, he would have thought that someone forgot to turn off the air conditioning.
