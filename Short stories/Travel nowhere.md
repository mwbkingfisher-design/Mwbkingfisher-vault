“The financial report of the company will be presented to you by Christina,” said Born, the company’s CEO.

“Like you can see on the charts, we are hitting the jackpot.” The woman on the screen grinned. “In the next quarter, we will be making even more money. The bonus idea remains like before.”

“Damn, blabbering,” hissed Mike to his colleagues.

“I think it’s going in the right direction,” said Jack. He always had been optimistic. Even when all the rumours were saying otherwise.

“Did you get any raise in the last two years?” Mike asked with a serious face.

“No, but…” Jack tried to find any logical arguments, but he failed in doing so.

“You see? The situation is fatal in my opinion.”

Mike hated those company meetings. The ‘C’ level had always talked about how the company was doing great, despite all the gossip and rumors that employees passed between themselves. He, Jack, and Christopher were the only people in the office. Most of the workers were doing remote jobs.

It was almost the end of the day, but Mike didn't think about going home. The task he had was complex but interesting. He wanted to finish it so much that even passing the eighth hour of working didn't convince him to go home. 

Jack had already gone home, but Christopher still worked as he started later, like Mike. 

They were making a break in the kitchen, talking about Mike's task. The smell of the coffee was swirling around the room as they sipped it. 

“There is nothing better than a late coffee,” said Christopher while drinking.

“Yea,” said Mike. 

“I spoke with Anna recently, and she told me an office legend,” started Christopher hesitantly, as if to tell Mike about it at all.

“A legend? How so. That building isn’t as old to have any legend—is it?”

“More than the office, it’s the company that has a legend,” he started, “it’s about an invisible employee.”

“Invisible? What do you mean?” That sounded ridiculous to Mike. How could someone who worked legally for that company be invisible? And moreover, how was that man connected to the office? They didn’t work on-site often, but Mike thought he knew all the people in there.

“In the office, there is a basement,” started Christopher, “and in that basement there are wonders. Wonders that you’ve never imagined of.”

“What the—”

“Remember that policy to reset your password every thirty days?” he asked.

“Yes,” said Mike.

Christopher lowered his voice to whisper and said. “Did you forget to change it even once?”

“No. I always do it on the last Monday of that period.”

“Exactly,” he grinned before continuing, “but if you forget to do it, you need to change it, and to change it... you need to go to the basement." Meet the IT Guy.”

Christopher took a few sips of the coffee, waiting for Mike's response. He was speechless, as that sounded like a bedtime fairytale.

“The IT Guy? You mean Derek?” asked Mike curiously.

“No… The Other IT Guy,” said Christopher and added mysteriously. “If you ask Derek about the password change, he will send you to The IT Guy in the basement.”

“Whaat? I don’t believe you. That sounds ridiculous. Utter nonsense.” Mike was drinking his coffee. He was almost choking from laughter. Such stories couldn’t be real. Just couldn’t. “Okay, even if that’s true, what then?”

“Basement is the place where even the most sane people can have a mental break.”

Mike rustled with a cookie bag, which he was trying to open. Christopher hated to be interrupted in such a way, so he stopped talking for a moment. Finally, Mike took one of the cookies with struggle, and his colleague continued the story. 

“The basement is a labirynth in which the experience is different for everyone entering it. For some, the dreams and fantasies come together at once, and for others, the deepest nightmares happen.”

All of these sounded like crazy stories to Mike. From the other side, he liked such tales, so he listened actively.

Christopher took one of the cookies, took a bite, and said the rest of the story.

“And when you’ll finish the labirynth, you will find the one you are looking for. The IT Guy. He will change your password.”

“But... why can’t he just work on this floor and not in the basement?" asked Mike.

“Oh man, it’s just the legend. I suspect nothing from what I said is real.”

The coffee cups were already empty, so they headed back to their desks. Mike still felt the coffee taste in his mouth while trying to wake up the computer.

*Login failed. Incorrect password.*

He didn’t expect that message. After a few more tries, he finally recalled what happened. This week’s Monday, when he was supposed to change the password, he had the day off. After it, he forgot about changing it. 

It wouldn’t be a daunting task, hadn’t he heard the legend. But in real life, there are no magic basements and no invisible employees. He wrote to Derek.

‘Hey Derek’, wrote Mike. His hands were trembling a bit. He knew that it was all made up, but well... There is always a seed of truth in the legends.

‘Mike. whatsup ;D'.  He liked Derek, as he was always fun to talk to.

“Man, I’m going home. Maybe I’ll work later, but I’ll see.” Christopher was already on the stairs, heading down.

“Sure, but man. Write you tomorrow, bye.”

“Bye.” And he was gone. Mike heard only the sound of the closing doors.

‘Man, you won’t believe. I forgot to change my password before the expiration date.’ He hoped that the change would last a few minutes at most.

‘Oh man, tough. But I cant help you.’

‘?? You are IT guy, aren't you?’ Mike was confused; he didn’t hear about any other IT guy. Unless the legend was true, which was nonsense to Mike.

‘You need to go to the basement and find the IT guy ;D. He will change your password.’ 

‘What? Are you serious? I’ve heard the legend, but that sounds like some weird stuff.’ He couldn’t believe what he was reading. It looked that the legends could be true after all.

‘Yea, I’m serious. The IT guy Joel is a nice guy after all.’ Derek wrote it as if it were a normal thing.

‘But why i never heard about him?’ That was the part that confused Mike the most. In normal company, you at least know that people exist.

‘You’ll see, he will tell you. Once you’ll be in the basement, input this code in the terminal next to the door: 4 2 6 4.’ 

‘Okay, thanks. Going, Bye ;P’ Mike wrote that message while thinking whether the legend was true or not.

He closed the notebook and stood from the chair. Anxiety started to crawl into Mike as he descended to the basement. Even though he was scared, there he was, standing in front of the basement door. The dark terminal was located on his eyesight, left to the door.

Normally, it would be a normal thing. It happened that some IT departments were located in the basement. But hearing all the stories from Christopher tuned Mike negatively. The horror things he could encounter in there made him skip the beat. Such fantasy things were not real, obviously, but what if? Such thoughts were swirling in Mike’s mind. 

With a shaking hand, he started to enter the code. Four, two, eight, beep. The loudest alarm Mike had ever heard started to ring in his head. He ran to the stairs, ready to go back, when silence fell over the room again.

“Oh, I think I’m exaggerating. Maybe I’m just tired, and that’s all.” muttered Mike.

He approached the terminal once again and entered the code. Four, two, six, four, click. The door to the basement opened, welcoming Mike with a complete darkness.

He took a look around the frame of the door, but the light switch was nowhere to be found. Only the terminal. 

Mike could withdraw. Maybe demand the password be changed remotely. Multiple options were available. Even quitting the job because of this nonsense would be feasible. Instead, he stepped into the darkness.

He was surprised with automatic lights lightening up the small corridor. Mike waited for the inevitable when he saw the maze turning right. It was really clean there, and Mike was hearing constant humming noises.

After the turn, he saw the unexpected. A large sofa, a table, and a TV hang on the wall. The loud whistling sound came from the television. There was an old-fashioned train riding through the beautiful country. Looking at the mountains, Mike could guess that it was maybe Switzerland.

The wind brushed Mike's hair. It blew from the end of the corridor through the slightly opened door. A faint light was pouring from a room. Mike was scared that this would be the first stage of an ordeal. He creeped to the door only to peek through inside.

There were clicking sounds coming from the keyboards and mice as Mike stood there in shock. No fantasies or horrors awaited for the employees. Instead, he saw the room full of people doing things on the computers. On the walls, there were the company's logos, but it wasn't Mike's. A big brown letter ‘T’ surrounded by small letters ‘I’, giving IT as a whole.

As he stepped into the vast space, nobody gave him any attention. He asked one guy about The IT Guy, and he pointed to the door on the end of that space. When Mike approached it, he saw the sign next to the door saying ‘The IT Guy’.

Inside, he noticed one tall, normally looking guy.

“Hello, how can I help you?” he asked. 

“Hi,” Mike paused to gather the thoughts. “I'm looking for the IT guy. I'd forgotten to change my password.”

“You are in the correct place. I'm Dave, and the company you see here is The IT Damned, and we are responsible for multiple companies’ systems. Which company are you from?”

“Ehm... Minta,” said Mike hesitantly.

“Perfect! And the username that you’re logging in with?”

“Mike.m.”

“Great! Your password is now reset. Once you wake up your computer, it will ask for a new password. Have fun!”

“Thank you.”

The hesitation was still clearly visible on Mike’s face. That was why Dave said. “You heard ‘the legend’, didn’t you?”

“Yes, I did,” said Mike.

“That’s all some weird ‘urban legend’ in that office. I think it’s because we are located in the basement. I hate it a bit, but well… what to do.” explained Dave.

“But why can’t I see you visible in my communicator?”

“That’s because we are an external company. Not connected to your active directory. But we do manage it.”

“Why our IT guy, Derek, doesn’t change password?” asked Mike.

“He has a lot of different things to do. Managing your company's accounts is under our control.”

“Alright… thank you.”

Confused, he stepped out of the room and the basement. After opening the notebook lid, he saw the popup. ‘Please enter your new password.’. Mike changed the password and saw the first message on Communicator. Coming from Caroline, the message said.

“Hey Mike! I’m writing from my phone. I forgot my password, do you know how we handle that?”

Mike smiled and wrote back. “Hey Caro, yea I know. Let me tell you a story…”
