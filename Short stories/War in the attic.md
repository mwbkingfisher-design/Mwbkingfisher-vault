Chris didn't like when mom told him what to do. Especially when she asked him to clean the attic. 

“No, I don't want to clean it! Why is it always me?”

“Always? It was dad who cleaned it ages ago because you preferred playing with your friends instead of helping him,” mom replied.

“But today, the guys also invited me as Mark’d got a new RPG, and we’re going to play it!” He tried enthusiastically to persuade her to let him go. 

“Chris, no. You can't go—not until the attic is cleaned.”

“Mom, please.” It might have worked ten years ago when Chris was four, but no, his mom was untouched. “I’ll do this tomorrow or the day after.”

“I hear that all the time; I won’t be fooled today,” mom replied.

“Okay,” Mark capitulated, “Only... I need to tell Mark that I can’t today.”

He ate the rest of a sandwich and left the kitchen, where they usually had breakfast. A few times, his parents let him eat in front of the computer or television, but most of the time, they forbade it. He picked up the phone from his bed. His room—a sanctuary, as he liked to call it—reflected all his passions, including RPG games and books lying in every corner.

“Hey, Mark?” Chris asked.

“Chris! I was just supposed to call you. Let's discuss today’s meeting!” From his excitation, he knew it would be hard to postpone the game. 

Mark was about to dive into the game’s details when Chris interrupted. “Ye, I’m calling about the game. I need to pass today.”

“What? No, no, no, I wanted to show you an instruction. You should help me show others how to play.”

“Sorry Mark. Really can’t. Maybe some other day? Tomorrow?”

"No, man, sorry. Tomorrow’s out; I need to study for the math exam. Maybe the day after tomorrow?”

“Sure, sounds good to me, unless my mom gives me some tedious tasks to do at home—again.”

“Oh, I get it. Mine forces me to do that all that errand crap too.” Mark said. 

“I better get going. A lot to do. Bye!” snapped Chris and hung up. He’d known that Mark would insist on him coming. With his attitude, he could fall for it, and he didn't want to disappoint his mom. That day, the right things were to be done. The sooner he started, the sooner he could go to Mark.

Sometimes, at his friends’ places, he saw a ladder leading to the trapdoor in the ceiling. In his house, it was different. He stood before the wooden stairs, leading to the attic. The locked door with a key inside was at the end of them. What was the point of having the key in there? That always bugged Chris, as he had been afraid that maybe his parents wanted to hide something in there. A monster they wanted to keep away from the main part of the house. Such fantasies were thrilling, but he knew it was just his wild imagination.

He knew there was a lot of cleaning to do. If it’d been a few months since someone cleaned anything there, it meant there was a lot of work. The infantile fantasies about monsters and imaginary creatures faded when he reached the last steps. His heart was racing as he turned the key with his slippery fingers. 

The morning sun filled the space through small windows on each side of the attic. Nothing had changed since he was there previously. Unused clothes rested on the shelves in the corner, and the cardboard boxes were scattered everywhere, showing what Chris's family had bought recently. Nobody took the trouble to at least pile them up in one place.

Two small bulbs hung dangerously from the ceiling by single thin wires. Chris had an uneasy feeling that they were swaying.

*Oh, man. There's going to be a lot of wiping to do,* said Chris.

Wrick was excited. Wars were common in Chagia, but the transfiguration ones happened rare. He’d polished his gear until it shined like nothing he had ever seen. He saw his scarred reflection in the polished breastplate. He remembered where he’d got every single scar on his face, and the pride filled him. The more scars meant more battles one was taking part in. And there was nothing better on that world than going mad into the fight. That sensation was overwhelming for any Chagian because the wars were something they’d lived for.

Dying was a common thing, and Chris died a few times during many years of war. The resurrection spell, cast by specialized mages, was even more awful than death. It only revived the dead, not heal them. That was the problem with that spell, and Wrick shuddered at the memory of rising from the dead. The pain of broken limbs and open wounds could break every man.

Wrick wondered if the fighting would ever stop. He hoped not, because there would be no more possibilities of proving himself. The growing excitement for the upcoming battle buzzed within him. He left the house, as there wasn't much time before the transfiguration.

Everyone outside were running around in a hurry. It was a huge event for everyone, so all Chagians were preparing themselves. The only silent place, in that uproar, was the mage tower. The mages prepared differently than anybody else. Silence and quieting down was the way for the mages and the archmages as the reviving spell required a lot of concentration.

Wrick saw his friend, Thaun, from afar. He was one of the best mages in Chagia and the one who usually revived him.

“It's a beautiful day for a war, hm, Thaun?”

“No, all these wars are stupid. If only someone could stop them. Tell me, Wrick, why are we wasting our resources and our lives for such stupidity?”

“Only you have such problems. Just look at everyone here—excited, happy, and joyful.”

“Hmpf,” Thaun grunted. Wrick found it hilarious as his sturdiness and body shape didn't fit such response at all. That was more fit for other mages, slim and thin old men. Although Thaun looked so differently from his kin, the rules he was living with were the same. Mages protected life, while warriors took it. Setting aside all those differences, he and Thaun were the best friends since as far as he remembered. From both of them, Wrick had been considered to be a mage in the past. His appearance had always been the mage-like one. He had even portrayed himself as a mage in all the games they’d played with Thaun. 

He liked to break skulls, even with his thin appearance. He couldn’t learn the spells, and especially the reviving spell. Without that spell, the candidate could never be a mage. Adding to that living to protect life, he couldn’t bear it much longer. He stepped into a path of the warrior.
[stoppp]
“What will we become this time?” broke the silence Thaun.
Wrick knew that he was talking about transfiguring. That kind of wars were exciting and nerve-wracking at the same time. The feeling of changing form in to something totally different, was the best feeling he’d ever experienced. Even breaking thousands of heads and surviving didn’t match anywhere close to the feeling of transforming into a wolf, an orc or any other creature. 
“Does it matter to you? Oh, actually it does. It would be best for you to be something not really noticeable, like ant, or some other bug,” Wrick noticed. He grinned when the point of his words finally reached Thaun’s mind.
“Well, I sense a lot of sarcasm in your words, but you are right. Something like this would be great,” agreed Thaun. “I want to be something big like bear or elephant. Or something scary enough to paralize our enemies.”
“Hopefully, you will be one of those. We cannot fail this time.”
“Why? Won’t you revive us like you always do?” Wrick surprise was written in his face.
“Yes, we will, but this is what we always tell to you dumb-head warriors. Fight like there’s no tomorrow. And protect us well, because without us —”
“—we are all dead without coming back, yeah I know,” interrupted Wrick. He was amazed with his hands so clearly reflected in his breastplate, when he asked. “What enemies this time?”
“I don’t know. Nobody do. We are going blindfolded now. The oracle division didn’t grasp who will we be facing. That should double our cautiousness.”
“We will see then. Let’s go, Thaun. Good luck on your mission!” said Wrick.
“Good luck on your mission!” Thaun replied and moved to the mage tower. He also needed to recharge himself to be his best for the upcoming battle.
Wrick went thence to the barracks where his warrior division stationed. It was a berserk one. The kind of people who push on to the battle first and usually die first as well.
“Ay, Wrick,” shouted Cruck.
“Hey, Cruck. Ready to smash some heads?” said Wrick grinning nonchalantly.
“Ya, smash’em,” replied Chuck.
On every wall hung various kinds of weapons. If that had been a normal war, everyone there would be caressing their weapons, but transfiguring made the weapons useless. Having sharp claws didn't help in holding anything. And having sharp teeth was even better than weapons. But it wasn't always some combat-proof creature. Wrick could remember times when he and his berserk division were transformed into butterflies. They weren't too dangerous in melee or range attacks, so they struggled in causing any damage to their opponents, the orcs from Kazarh. It was that butterflies’ kin poisonous powder that killed them eventually. Only a few Chagia people were injured as some arrows hit their wings. Mages didn't have much to do in that battle.
“Please gather here,” said Jock, the commander of the berserk division. He discussed different tactics in different situations. During transfigured wars all Chagia’s divisions had two two variances of battles. General and division specific. The first was applied by all divisions according to what they faced. Different transformations of allies and enemies were taken into account and led to different solutions. Chagians who wanted to join any division, needed to learn all tactics, as simple mistake could ruin a whole battle. Most of them were easy and self-explanatory like: if enemies will turn into chickens and allies into foxes then just slaughter them. Others were more sophisticated as transformations weren’t only animal-related. Other situations, like turning allies into ghosts and enemies into powerful elves, were also discussed.
Wrick was Jock’s right hand, so they splat into two subgroups to discuss some tactics more thoroughly. He was in the middle of explaining giants versus worms’ transmigration when he heard sounds of a brawl. He looked into that way to see an unusual view. He knew that the Chagians were too proud and overworked with wars to fight among themselves, so he was surprised after seeing Cruck and another berserker fighting over the weapon between them.
“Kill ya. Smash’ya head.” Wrick heard familiar Cruck’s cries.
“You? Ha.” An even louder shouting could be heard across the barracks. “The best thing you can do with a head is to smash yours into the wall.”
“Just try ya!”
Wrick was just about to cut in when the giant sword slammed and broke the disputed weapon into the pieces. 
“Nobody,” Jock's angry voice resounded clearly in the air, “will ever again start the fight when we are about to descend into the battle, am I clear?”
“Ya, commanda,” said Cruck without any hesitance.
“Alright,” said another Chagians, but after Jock walked away he whispered, “just you wait when we will be in some quieter place Cruck Gr—”
Instead of the last mocking word, blood flowed from his mouth. He was beheaded with the same sword that slammed between them before.
“I don’t handle well rejection and acting behind my back,” hissed Jock. 
Silence took over the place and only the rolling head could be heard. With a slap it hit the wall with a twisted expression pointing on the berserkers. Wrick knew that this Chagian will never again be revived, but that destiny was brought to him only by himself.
“Let’s go back to tactics.” Jock’s normal tone of voice was astounding considering killing one of his own kin so cold-hearted. Wrick wondered if maybe that was the reason why there were no brawling amongst Chagians. The commander was required to be a rough and durable person. Everyone came back to the two subgroups, and the beheaded Chagian’s body was left were it laid.b 
“So, giants versus worms. Let’s sum it up and move on.” Wrick started when the barracks were filled with a orange light. The transfiguration incantations began. All mages were filling the black portal with an energy to be used later when sending all the soldiers into the battle. That power would both send the troops and make the transfiguration.
Seeing that, all berserkers made a bowl and move to the portal direction. 
Jock moved first, then all the division, and Wrick at the end. As that were the last moments before the battle, the excitement took over to the point that he was almost trembling.
The view of all divisions was astonishing. Usually, there had been a bit of time for them on the other side to prepare before the fight. But because  it wasn't always a case, there was a specific order of groups. The berserks on the front, followed by the strongmen, the thinkers, with the mages at the end. They were the most important division as without them neither reviving not portal incantations would be possible. All the tactics would fall apart if enemy would start to attack the mages. In that case so the divisions were supposed to protect them.
There were magic chains going from the mages up to the portal. Everyone, even the casters themselves, could feel the power emitting from the smudges of light. The surge of light followed giant explosion. The portal was finally formed after a long time of incantations. 
All commanders gather in one place facing the portal. After a bit of talking to each other, each one came back to the proper division shouting words to boost a morale.
“Good luck on your mission!” cried Jock.
“Good luck on your mission!” All the divisions synchronized war cries.

Chris dragged bucket with mop on the stairs. One by one. A bit of water slipped from the bucket, but he didn't bother with it. 
“Stupid cleaning. And they’d already started playing probably.” Seeing all the dust on the attic made Chris only more grumpier. He decided to not complain, clean everything fast and good enough, and maybe he would be on time to play for a while with guys. The attic was in the same state as when he checked it out for dust. Rays of sun were pointing to the paper box in the middle of the attic. It was Amazon box after some kitchen machine delivery. 
It was a perfect way to start cleaning the attic. One alone box in the middle. Chris looked inside to see only bubble wrap and instruction. It was the packaging for a toaster, one they hadn't used for a long time then. He threw it near the exit to have all trash in one pile, to throw them out later. It bounced a few times, leaving the opening on one side. The bubble wrap and instruction book felt from it on the floor. 
“Shit.” cursed Chris. Everything that day was not going well. 
He picked clothes that were on the floor, putting them inside the plastic bags. Having them in a bag of gym-ball size, he stored them on shelves.
“Well, that will do for this part. Maybe let's wipe the windows now,” he said checking one thing on the list *to be done*. There were only two of them on the attic, so It wasn’t a long time before every dust on the glass had been wiped. More sun bathed Chris’s face, he squinted eyes to see the road outside. A white Mercedes drove through. A noise make him twist the head to the middle of the attic. The sound was coming from near the clothes’ shelves. He walked there slowly and cautiously, leaving only footsteps in dust behind. He found there nothing at all. One of bags felt to the floor and made the noise. Without any thoughts, he just took it and put back on the shelve. The floor wiping went fast as well and as there was nothing else left to do, Chris decided to take all the cleaning tools back to their places. After that there was only trash to remove left.
The attic looked like anew, with everything sorted out and wiped. A big grin appeared on Chris face as he imagined himself licking the floor.
“Bleh. No, no, no.” He felt disgust after a moment.
That glass in a window was really clean.  He liked when there was not even the one stain on the surface. But what he saw in there shocked him. Chris couldn't utter a word. He didn’t saw a street with cars. He saw a milky white fog which filled every inch of his view.
“What the fu—” A blink of light interrupted his last curse. It was followed by a big explosion. In the opening of the Amazon box he put down for throwing, there appeared to be a jelly-like surface moving like a flag on a windy day. 
Although it was encouraging to touch, he decided going to his parents to discuss that weird events. Chris walked down the stairs and was surprised to see the locked door.
“Mom?” he asked. 
“Mom, are you there? Hey?” That sentence Chris said with a much louder voice. If anyone was there, they would hear him by then.
That wasn't something that happened everyday, and both fog and the explosion weren't as scary as the vision of being locked at the attic. The bulbs at the ceiling started to flicker making Chris even more anxious. Step by step, he came back at the attic to look through the windows. He hoped that the fog had cleared and he would be able to cry to someone for help. But it didn't, in contrary, it was more dense than before.
“Well, crying for help is out of board.” muttered Chris. 
The jelly surface in the box glowed with a pink color, attracting Chris to it. Having to choose from fear and curiosity, he chose the latter. It smelled with fresh apples and Chris immediately wanted to eat one such apples. But when he recalled about no response from lower floors, all the dreamy thoughts faded. 
The surface mirrored his face when he crouched to see inside the box. It reminded him of a calm sea, except it was glowing and unexpected. He couldn’t resist touching it. He wanted to start with just one finger to check how it’d go. But after barely touching the surface, it started crawling onto his arm. Chris tried to jump back but he couldn’t. He stuck to the surface like to a glue. He skipped a beat and felt his heart in his throat. 
“What the hell, what is it.” The more he struggled, the more the surface engulfed him. “Leave me alone. Help!” he cried.
No one came to help him while the pink substance had already been on his neck, crawling straight toward his head. It covered his eyes and the next moment he opened it, he wasn’t in his attic anymore. The place looked like the middle of the forest, with wooden walls around him. There was no windows, and as a source of light there was only the moon shining high above his head. The room was empty, except for a lone furniture, which supposed to be a chair, but made from branches and leaves. 
There was literally nothing else there, so Chris decided to sit on that, and think about his situation. He remembered situation with pink substance and touched the chair with his fingers. Nothing happened so he decided to sit. The moment he touched it with his bottom, branches entangled him tightly not allowing him to stand up. Everything happened too quickly for him to react. He was terrified in the similar way when he encounter pink surface. The branches tightly wrapped around him, and one of them was heading toward his mouth. 
He didn’t like horror movies, but had seen enough of them to know what that branch was going to do. In his mind, he started saying goodbye to the world and to his family. He was sad and felt self-pity with a fact that he was so unwilling to make any chores that Mom gave him. He tried to shout, and the moment he opened his mouth, the branch invaded his throat. He chocked, closing his eyes.
*This is the end, love you.* Chris said the last words while thinking about his family. Soon after that he fainted. Or at least that was what he thought, as in the next second he opened his eyes again.
He wasn’t entangled anymore, and not even in the chair. He was standing, but something was off. The perspective that he was in, seemed too high. Chris looked down just to see not his body anymore. He was a young boy, skinny and without much muscularity. But the body he was now in, had all possible muscles shaped. The limbs were all too long as well. The hands instantly moved to his head, just to discover long ears. *What the… am I an elf?* Chris wondered. That much likely fit the appearance of elves in games and movies.
“Did you finish?” Unknown voice echoed in his head.
Chris looked around him and didn’t see anyone.
“Is there anyone here?” he asked.
“Yes.”
“Where? I can’t see you.”
“Are you stupid? Of course you can’t see me. I’m in your head, I’m you and you are me!” the voice answered, as it was something obvious to know.
“You… are in my head? I don’t understand.” said Chris.
“You are just from different world. Tell me, did you enter a pink layer?”
“A pink layer? Ah, a pink portal! Yes!” agreed Chris.
“Eh, you just don't know. So it's your first time? That was the transfiguration layer, portal, surface… there are many names for that.” explained the voice.  “It took you from your body and transformed your soul into my body. My kin is known for welcoming transfigured guests in their bodies.”
“A kin? A transfiguration?” asked Chris dumbfounded.
“No… you are deaf, are you?” said the voice. 
“I'm not. It's just all confusing. I don't know what you meant.”
“I'm Jork and I'm the prince of Holens,” Jork started, “From time to time, they send us foreigners to control our bodies. Not that we want that, but we don’t have a lot of choice?”
“So I can go back to my body. How to leave this world and go to mine?” asked Chris.
“That’s not possible. Not until the war ends.”
“The war?”
“Yes, the transfiguration happens not only to us… you…, there is also some other race that we don’t know yet.”
Jork was sharing the mind, but only Chris controlled the body. He finally got a time to look around and assess the situation. The vast space surprised him at first. It looked like huge warehouse, but in a tree. Behind him, was a big throne made from branches and leaves. It reminded Chris the entangling chair that he sat on.  On the opposite side, kneeling before him, there were thousands of elves. Looking at their gear, Chris recognized warriors—lightly armored soldiers of all kinds. The ones with bows were kneeling behind the ones with swords and daggers. They were waiting. None of them dared to say anything. He could feel that many of them were holding their breaths.
“I was commanding them before you… invaded me. They saw what happened and they know what that means. The army is waiting for a speech.”
"So what should I do?"asked Chris.
After a bit of silence Jork said. “You probably weren't a prince in your world.”
“No.” said Chris. 
“So tell them what do you think the prince of an army would said.”
He felt that they were counting on what he would say. 
"Ehm... Hello?” He didn't really know what to say. In the RPGs he played, multiple time he'd commanded such an army.
“Hello? Are you talking to an old lady, or to army ready to face their destiny? Let me take the lead.” said Jork.
“Give you the lead. What do you mean by that?” asked Chris.
“Even if you control the body, you can give me access to it for a few minutes. Just think about it to make that happen.”
Chris thought about giving control to Jork, but nothing happened at first. But after a while, he could see the arms moving without his will to move them.
“Brothers and sister.” He could hear and see himself shouting. It was without a doubt Jork talking. “Finally, there came a time. I received blessing of The Roots. The Foreigner is now here with me, in my body, letting me talk to you. That was the last of the prerequisites for the war. We can… no… we will win.” The thunder of enjoyment reached his ears and echo was winding through the chamber for a long time.
“For the Holens.” Jork screamed finishing his speech.
The soldiers were overjoyed. They were screaming, “Holens! Holens! Holens!”
“You see, this is how you make a speech.” said Jork with a smirk.
Chris was once again able to move the body. "What to do now?"
"Tell them in similar tone to head towards the portal.” said Jork. 
“Head to the portal.” shouted Chris in a squeaky voice. 
The sudden change of tone, surprised army, but it still threw towards one direction. 
“Holens! Holens!” They still heard fading away chants.
“Good. You just need to work on the voice tone. Too squeaky.” said Jork.
“What now?” asked Chris. He liked this situation more than he could admit.
“We cannot go into war before I'll teach you how to use my powers. My body, to be precise.”
They moved through a huge wooden corridor. It was either a one monstrous tree, or that wasn't the tree in the first place. Chris felt like in a pipe. Even when he spoke to Jork, his voice was bouncing off the walls.
“Where are we going?” he asked. 
“We have some spare time before going to the portal, so we are going to the training room.”
They entered a much smaller room. On the walls were shelves with every kind of weapon that Chris could imagine: swords, spears, bows, and daggers. Everything that he had only seen in games was there.
“Take the daggers. This is what my body is proficient in.” said Jork.
“But I can't use them. They look almost like knives,” said Chris taking one of them to his hands, “but I know the way of handling with these is much different.”

“Yes, usually you use them differently, but it’s totally depends on situation.”  noticed Chris. “But don’t worry. My body is controlled by your actions, but it still contains a muscle memory. You just need to think what do you want to do, and my body will do rest.”

“That’s impossible!” He took two of the daggers and tried what the prince just said. In the middle of the room, there were ragged mannequins. Just one thought about stabbing one of them was enough. His body moved automatically, making the whole sequence of cutting, stabbing, and parrying.

“Possible, otherwise my kin would die a lot. There aren't many fighters among the guests.” said Jork. “Muscle memory is one thing, but the other is accessing a body.”

“Why it even is a thing? Why do we even appear in your bodies?” Chris couldn't grasp why such transfiguration is even needed when all the powers and all the intuitions came from the prince body.

“It happens without anyone willing to make it happen. It’s just part of us, unfortunately.” said Jork. “Different species have different types of transfiguration. The most common one is physical change.”

“Physical? What does it mean.” asked Chris. 

“Their body change. Literally, they can be anything. Anything.” Jork hissed.

“That's sounds like a trouble.”

“Yes, they have advantage of being in different body. And the disadvantage, if the body is incapable for fighting.” Jork paused for a moment. “The more I think about it the more I think we are lucky to be mentally transfigured.”

“Why do you think so.” asked Chris. 

“Because our bodies are capable to do the same things as they were before the transfiguration. Even though we have a guest, we are able to not die quickly because of our muscle memory.”

They spent a whole day on training. Muscle memory was working perfectly. Without any previous training, Chris was able to fight the way he saw only on the movies, like a professional soldier. After such amount of exercises, at the end of the day, Chris expected to be wet and sweaty. Instead, his body felt anew and fresh.

“Let's finish it for today.” said Jork.

“Are we going to the war now?” Chris felt chills going down through Jork’s spine. He didn't want to ask the question that was mangling through his mind.

“No, we will go to sleep now.”

“But the soldiers, you send them to the portal!” Chris asked surprised. 

“Ah, they will be fine. Holens soldier’s life is not easy.”

They were heading through the next corridor when Jork asked. “What's going on? Is there something on your mind?”

“I'll just straight ask. What will happen to me if I… We… would die?”

“Nobody really knows what happen then. It's not like we had many opportunities to ask.”

“That’s really not comforting to know.” said Chris.

“You have wrong feeling that I wanted to comfort you.”

He didn’t ask anymore questions. Jork would most likely answer them all. The problem was whether Chris wanted to know the answers.

***

Wrick appeared in the vast space with the high walls around him. Many little suns were hunging from the ceiling lighting up the whole place. In the corner, he saw shelves full of clothes. The first notion that came into his mind was that they were in princess’s garderobe. It wasn’t common to have so much clothings overall. Then he looked at boxes near the stairs.

“That is odd.” he murmured.

The air around him was stiff and wet. It was almost like the dense fog behind the small windows finding the way to his mouth.

Finally, he saw what they’d become. Some of Chagians became plastic small humanoids, while others were fluffy little bears and animals. The toys? That was something that’d never happened before. To be something not-breathing; that was new. He tried to take a mouthful of breath, but nothing happened. There was no air, no breath. 

“That’s something new,” growled Jock.

“Yes, commander,” said Wrick.

“But it’s not something we won’t be able to handle, right soldiers?”

“Yes commander,” cried soldiers in unison. 

Wrick’s look was bear-like. His arms and legs were in a barrel’s shape, and there were no claws at the end of them. He had no fur but some silk material instead.

“It will be hard to fight with these,” said Wrick.

“Do you want to switch?” asked Jock. He was something even harder to explain than Wrick. It looked like a carriage with wheels, made from a kind of shining stone. He could even peer inside and see a black interior.

“What are you even are?”

“I don't know, but it's much faster than a horse.” He drove fast in circles for a proof.

“At least they won’t catch you, whoever they are,” said Wrick.

They saw the plastic bird flying in the air. It was shaking like a raw meat hanging from the stick. The thing was flying closer to them with every minute. Jock escaped that place in a haste.

“Sorry Wrick. I cannot die yet,” said Jock.

“Shit,” murmured Wrick.

The bird was making smaller and smaller circles around him and lay not far away from his paws.

“Ah, that thing is hard to control.” The voice was rustling, but it didn’t take much for Wrick to recognize Thaun’s voice.`

“Thaun? Is that you?” asked Wrick.

“Yes, it’s me. Hello, Wrick. I see you are fluffy,” grinned Thaun.

“Oh, give me a break. I hate that form. I much more prefer to be real animals.” Wrick waved his paw to proof his words. “What can I do with that weird material. I can be torn at most.”

Hesitantly, he approached the flying machine that Thaun has become. Touching the paw agains the surface was like touching the rock. Wrick didn’t know if that the material of Thaun’s flying bird is so hard, or his paw is so light.

“At least you can fly and stay at the backs,” noticed Wrick.

“Yes, that’s true, but hopefully I won’t hit the walls with it.”

They laughed. Wrick found his form really reassuring. Flying around and keeping away from the dangers was the first predicament to be revived.

“Are other mages in the same form as you?” he asked.

“It’s hard to tell, as usual, in that transfiguration wars,” noticed Thaun.

“Right, right. So where are the foes?”

“I recon they still didn’t arrive.” He rotated in place to check around for any newcomers.

“Good luck on your mission!” grunted Thaun and flied away.

Wrick was looking at Thaun’s weird machine dissapearing in the distance, wondering how peculiar the whole army looked like, most likely. The band of silky, stuffed, and fluffy animals, alongside of some weird machines driving and flying around.

Nothing, except clothings and boxes, was in his linesight. He went to look through the windows and saw the lights. He was almost about to tell the others when the lights dissapeared.  Who knew about weird sensations that could happen in that body. There were stairs that went down, but that path was finished with, as the others already checked, the closed door.

All that they could do was waiting. The army set themselves in the best positions for an attack. They constantly heard some voices coming either from the windows, or the door, but nothing interrupted their focus on what was about to happen soon.

One of the windows blinked, and changed into mirror-like surface.

“There it comes. Prepare!” shouted Jock.

---

Chris opened his eyes. He regained most of the energy and felt fresh even more than before. He still couldn’t believe what was happening. The tree, the army—all of these was still surreal to him. Slowly, he opened his eyes.

“We are ready to go!” said Jork in their mind.

Chris didn’t oppose that and followed where the prince said to go. The portal opened into another tree room, just as vast as the first. It was a mirror-like surface, which was reflecting the impressive army. Gracefully, feeling the lightness of the body, he approached it, and touched with his fingers. Upon the contact, the ends of his fingers melted and dissapeared. As soon as as he retracted the fingers, they appeared once again.

“Brothers and sisters!” shouted Jork after taking control from Chris. 

“The war. The war is something inevitable. Like it or not, we live for the war. The war is where we are born, and the war is where we die. Die as a heroes. Die for Holens!” 

“Holens! Holens! Holens!” Jork’s speech started warriors’ chants again. The noise was overwhelming, and it made him focus on that war. He needed to win; that was the only way to see his parents and friends again. He couldn't hope that after dying he would just reappear in his previous body. It was better to be pessimistic and be pleasantly surprised.

“Let’s go! Into the unknown!” Chris finished the speech.

They let the warriors go first into the portal. Watching the army go, they was preparing themselves.

“Why couldn’t we stay here?” asked Chris.

“We need to go inside. Much more horrible thing happens to the Holens that won’t participate in the war.”

“Horrible thing?”

“Yes,” Jork voice saddened, “they go insane. That, at least from what I saw, is much more horrible and depressing than being dead.”

“Okay, than I suppose we don’t have much more choice.”

“Let’s go, Chris. Let’s face the unknown.”

While the last soldier was transferring to the battlefield, they approached the portal. With a hesitation Chris, controlling Jork’s body, stepped into the unknown.

---

On the first moment, Chris was glad that he was back at the attic, in his home. Maybe all of it was just a dream. Chris thought that maybe he slipped on the wet floor, hitting his head. He could go downstairs and meet his family for a lunch. That was when the reality hit him. The war was not over, and he, along with Holens were going into a battle. 

There'd already been clashes between two armies. The army shrunk to a proper height to face the opponents. To Chris's surprise, the fully equipped warriors were fighting the teddy bears, toy airplanes, and small plastic cars.

"These are my toys! They were tightly hidden in the bags," said Chris.

"The transfiguration war can do a lot of things to stuff. The bags were probably unhidden."

"But... these are just toys. They are already at a disadvantage. How can toys face such an army?"

"They can, and they're already doing that. Look." Jork mentally nodded in a direction of the scuffles. 

Many of the soldiers had already fallen. They died by massive, with their current height, paws. On the other hand, Holen's weapons were useless. Arrows were sticking out of the teddy bears' fluffy bodies, making no harm to them. Sword and spears had done better, but still, they could only cut through the fabric. It didn't stop the foes from moving and killing.

None of Holen's fighters could face any of the opponents alone. Three or more warriors were needed to cut one teddy bear into the pieces. The airplanes were flying above their heads, killing many of the soldiers. They were trying to aim at the machines with arrows, but even if any succeeded in hitting them, it just bounced off.

"We are losing," said Chris. 

"Yes, but that's not the end. The most important part of the battle is yet to come."

"What do you mean?" It already looked like a war to Chris, and what could be more important part of the battle than the battle itself?

"The fighting is only a way to discourage leaders. The final step in this is a clash between chosen leaders."

"What? And you're saying this now?" shouted Chris. 

"Well, what difference would it make to tell you earlier?"

"I would prepare."

"Ha, how? If you cannot do it with a help of my body and the muscle memory, you cannot do it with just some preparation."

"You said chosen leaders. Don't you have an officer to fight for us?" asked Chris.

"I have a lot of fine man to fight, but it's a custom for a king to do it by himself."

"Oh, damn the customs."

"No. You have to do it alone. I will help you."

More and more Holen's warriors were dying under fluffy teddy bears' paws. The more Chris thought about it, the more ridiculous it became. 

---

There were fewer Holen's fighters with every minute passed. Their count decreased by a half in a mere moment. The noise broke through that scene of despair. It was coming from the behind of the cloth shelves. That sound came from the tiny toy cars varying in type, from small hot wheels cars to big heavy trucks. They didn't seem to have any weapon unless they themselves were the weapon. And they drove really fast. 

Some of the cars crashed on each other, like it would be teens driving for fun. They hit the warriors with a loud thunk. They couldn't survive the impact, and the number of Holens decreased a lot. 

Apart of those death and life situations, Chris was amazed with the scenery. The ray of the morning sunlight was breaking through the window and the mist outside. It cast the light to the wooden floor, where clashes took place. 

One of the teddy bears was dying and falling on one of Holen's warrior. With no way to escape, the bear crashed him into a flat mass.

Chris was getting more and more anxious about the fight. But in the same time, he saw no way of escaping the final fight.

One of the bears approached him. The paw started to fall on him and Jork. Almost instictively, they dodged it to the side. Chris was paralyzed with the fear.

"Give me the control!" shouted Jork.

Chris did that immediatelly. The prince took the sword from the fallen warrior and swinged it, cutting the bear in half.

"Chris, snap out of it. That's a war!" said Jork.

He nodded, tightening his grip on the sword's hilt. 

"Let's go. We need to find our opponent." Jork said and they both started to look around.

"Maybe that one?" Chris pointed on the car, that was crashing the warriors one by one with just driving into them.

"Noo, I'm pretty sure it's not."

"How can you be so sure?" asked Chris. 

"I just know this after looking at it for a moment," said Jork, adding, "that airplane flying on the back looks promising."

They gazed at the circling machine far in the attic's back. It didn't do anything except flying. 

"Why do you think so,  it doesn't even kill anything."

"Leaders usually stay on back. They have more responsibility than just to kill," said Jork. "But this one is probably not the leader either."

They tried to find the correct opponent to fight with, but it was hard to do that in this scene of splattering blood and flying fabrics.


Chris noticed his teddy bear from the young years. It was tattered with threads coming out of him here and there. One eye had been removed long time ago. Chris's told the story to Jork. 

The big teddy bear with a one brown eye was killing a warrior when Chris spotted him. It was his bedtime mascot, with a tattered material and threads sticking out here and there. He just knew that this was the one. 

"What about this one?" Chris asked pointing to noticed teddy bear. 

"Let me check," said Jork and shouted, "Yes! That's the one. How did you know?"

"That's my mascot."

"Aren't all of these yours?" asked Jork.

"Yea, but this is the special one. Me and that toy were inseparable in the past," Chris said, and continued, "I was taking him, literally, everywhere. That's why it's so tattered and damaged."

Jork didn't respond, actively listening to the rest of the story. 

"I don't remember a lot from my childhood, but there is a one story I recall very well," said Chris as he was looking mindlessly at a car smashed with multiple swords. "I was fighting with one of my childhood friends, Jack. We were arguing about some important, for kids at least, stuff when he pulled a leg of the bear. I was holding it tight but had less strength than Jack. It slipped out of my hand so I held only an eye in the end. Then something snapped and only the eye stayed in my hand."

"Couldn't your parents sew the eye back?" asked Jork.

"No, it felt into the sewer."

"Sewer? What's that? Couldn't you just take it from there?"

Chris realized that Jork wasn't from his world. He liked him, but he couldn't know anything related to Chris's reality.

"It's not so easy, to take it from there, let's say it felt into the really deep, narrow hole in the ground. So narrow that you can't even put the hand in there," said Chris after a moment.

"I see, so what did you do?"

"I was a baby; I cried."

"Couldn't they just attach any other button to it?" Jork asked. 

"Probably they didn't have any, so my father told me that it was a war scar, and you should wear ones with proud."

"Sounds like a bad excuse."

"Yup, but I was a child, so I accepted it without any objections." Said Chris, looking at the soldiers around them. All of them had scars, and most of them were dead. They didn't look proud; it was rather the opposite.

"That's the one we are looking for!" Jork said after listening to Chris's story. 

"It isn't doing anything spectacular like the car or the airplane we saw."

"Sometimes, the transfiguration gives us some signs. I think this is one of them. Let's go."

Chris, still not used to running so fast, quickly evaded all the clashes between armies, and a few moments later he was standing next to his opponent, his mascot. The only thing that changed was Chris's size.

The one brown eye stared at them as they stood before him. 

"Here you come, at last." Chris heard the exact sound of the voice that he'd always imagined.  Powerful and deep, chilling the the bone.

"You are my teddy bear!" Chris shouted. He felt his muscles tighten at the sight of the foe. It was surely the muscle memory knowing what was going to happen. 

"I'm your what? I'm your opponent, and that's the only thing you should care about," growled their opponent, taking the stance of a bear ready to attack.

Jork's body moved in an instant just when a paw started to descent. He swung his hand, cutting through the fabric with his dagger. It didn't slow the toy which tried to catch them into his mouth. Chris didn't know that his bear had a mouth—let alone teeth as sharp as knives.

No blood ran from the wounds inflicted on the teddy bear. No matter how many times Chris hit him, the opponent didn't seem to notice. As if he was a fly that didn't even bite.

On the other side, heavy punches struck Chris constantly. He couldn't breathe when his ribs were smashed. 

“We can't hurt him. Is he even feeling the pain?” asked Chris. 

“From the way he's behaving, I assume he isn't,”

The fight was one sided. Although Chris and Jork had advantage in speed, the toy overpowered them in terms of strength and range of his attacks.

“So what do we do?” asked Chris nervously. He didn't want to die as he still hadn't the knowledge if he would be revived. 

“Usually, if the leader is transfigured, some flaws in his body may be hidden. We can use them to win,” Jork made a stop there and confirmed after a bit. “I don't see any flaws in that foe. We need to continue pushing in hope to maybe guy him in half.”

The daggers were swinging furiously leaving wounds on the toy’s body, but none of them succeeded in cutting it in half. A sudden punch sent Chris flying into the cardboard box.

There were losing, and could do nothing about it. Even the muscle memory wasn't helpful in that fight.

Chris spotted a lot of threads going out of the teddy bear. Looking at them in general didn't seem to be harmful for the teddy bear, but one in particular cought his attention. He had a strong memory related to it. When he was a child, his Mom had told him not to bite the threads, especially one in particular. When he did, the whole bear had ripped into pieces. After that, mom sewed him up, and the story started anew.

An idea came to Chris’s mind. To execute it, he would need to be fast enough and use his muscle memory to the maximum. The paw ascended high again and was about to hit them, when the prince ducked, cutting in the place where the thread was. In a moment, the bear’s arm ripped, and his paw dropped on the flor with a loud thump sound. It didn’t take a lot of time for the rest of bear to fall apart.

“Nooo!” Chris and Jork could hear only the last word coming from the toy. It was loud, squeaky, faded over time, but still powerful.

Bright light came from the remains of their opponent. It was so intense that everyone on the attic had to squint their eyes. In the middle of that white light, they saw two purple points shining brighter with every second. 

Chris felt irresistible force dragging him to one of the lights. He tried to move on the other direction, but inch by inch the light pulled him closer.

“Hey, what is happening. I can't move.” Chris was confused and nervous.

“Well, the war is over. The transfiguration takes us home. It's normal after a victory.” Jork’s steadiness calmed Chris, and after a moment, he continued. 

“What about the rest of the warriors? And our opponents?”

“Our people are going to be dragged away, like us. Home. As for the opponents, they need to mend themselves before returning home.”

“Mend themselves? Many of them are dead. I reckon healing won’t be enough.”

“Every nation has a way to revive the fallen ones. It is necessary to have such ability when fighting in transfiguration wars.”

“So it's a never ending story? Can this be even stopped?”

“Only when the whole army dies. And that happened only once.” Jork paused as if he was thinking about that situation. Chris assumed that maybe he was taking part in the battle.

The purple light was closer and closer. That made him nervous even after Jork’s promises that they’re going home. 

In the blink of an eye, Chris appeared in the same hall they had been portalled away from.

Chris is dragged into a portal in the end. They appeared in the workshop where it all began. 

Jork thanked Chris
