Brooke's interview was a disaster. It started extraordinary well. The beginning questions went smoothly. The technical part and talking with a manager couldn't go any better.

It was so well that instead of a handshake, the manager wanted to tap and squeeze Brooke's shoulder. And that was when the inevitable happened.

She was a young, slender woman. Her appearance didn't give a hint about the beloved hobby of hers. The martial arts of any kind, which she trained almost every day. 

“Oh no. Please don't do it,” she said, but it was already too late. 

The moment a hand of an interviewer touched her shoulder, she grabbed it, twisting painfully. A loud crack could be heard in the room. She threw him over her shoulder. Two HR girls who also sat at the table screamed and ran.

Broke could see a man, holding onto his arm and weeping sadly. She did it again. 

“Sorry about that, that was pure muscle memory. I didn't mean to do it.”

But nobody listened to Broke anymore. Security guards came to throw her out of the building. 

Maybe next time, she would be more lucky. Three times a charm.
