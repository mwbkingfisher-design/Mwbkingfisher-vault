Prompt: 
[SP] You are on a journey to literally find yourself.

Story:
The office was normal, except that it was entirely painted in bright green. This disturbed Henry. What disturbed him even more was lack of his legs. He floated in the air above the highly polished wooden floor. In front of him, in an armchair sat a man with ridiculously long beard. His sight was constantly wandering to it.

“So you really don’t know how did you get here?” the man asked.

“No, the last thing I remember is getting off the tram.”

The man wrote something in his documents with an excessively bright red colored pen.

“Hmm,” he thought about something for a few seconds, “it could be hard to send you in a correct timestamp. I think—yes, I can send you something around an hour after the event.”

“Wait, wait! Where am I? Why don’t I have legs?” said Henry. His calm posture was slowly giving way to panic.

“You are dead. Your legs are gone. I think it’s perfectly normal for a ghost to float?”

“Normal? A ghost?” A shock stopped him from saying anything. 

“Yes,” said a man writing even more in his documents. Then he looked at Henry and said so fast that the words were almost impossible to grasp, “good. Now, after we sorted this out, I'll tell you what we're going to do.”

Henry tried to say something but couldn't. 

“I see you want to say something, but I blocked it. Let me finish and we'll split our ways.”

He didn't rush an answer that time, so Henry could process everything.

“When someone dies, the memories are usually in place. But if someone dies abruptly or fell unconscious, we've a blank page in our documents to fill. As it's not our life we’re trying to assess, the person alone should gather that information before going further.” 

The man waited. Henry thought that maybe he wanted a response from him, so he tried to tell something, but no words left his mouth. 

“Oh, I forgot I'd blocked you,” the man giggled, “so, to be concise, find out what'd happened to you before you appeared here.”

The man stopped talking and put his head in his documents again. Henry tried to have his attention. He approached the desk, waving his hands. Then he tried to shout, but there was no sound coming.

The bearded man glanced and Henry, skilled and said, “You are still here? Oh, a button, right.” He pressed a big black button next to him, and Henry was sure it hadn't been there before.

With a snap, he stayed in the middle of a tram station, the last place he remembered. It was an afternoon, and everything around looked exactly the same way. People standing on the station, cars and trams driving a road, pedestrians going in different directions.

Henry was still in a shock, but he hoped it was just a dream. He looked down, and his heart skipped a beat. In the place where the legs should be there was only a road. He was still a ghost. 

His breath calmed after a moment as Henry tried to recall a recent conversation with the man in the office. He should find out what happened to him, or what was more likely, his body.

He tried his new ghost-like body for a couple of minutes. Soon, he found out that his new body was more capable than his previous one. Nothing was aching, and he was much more agile with it. And the best part was flying. He couldn't fly high up in the air to reach airplanes, but it was good enough to see everything around him.

He remembered where it was that he left the tram, and he saw a group of people at that station and police officers walking around. He flew closer to ask what was happening, but he stumbled on the next surprise. Nobody seemed to notice him. 

“Sorry, what's going on here?” he asked one of pedestrians. 

He heard no answer, and the pedestrian didn't even bother to look at him. Henry tried asking someone else, but again, without a result.

That disturbed him. He wasn't used to being ignored. After a bit of experimenting, he noticed that his touch couldn't reach anyone. He really was a ghost. He knew that the death is inevitable, but who’d have known it'd happen on a tram station

“…they hit him… took into the back and drive away…” Henry overheard pedestrians. He flew to the pedestrians to listen to more.

“That was frightening. They’d driven like maniacs and hit the poor guy,” said one of them.

“The weirdest part when they didn’t even stop for a moment. Two guys got out of the car, took the body and put it into trunk. Did you see where they drove away?”

“I think it was into the city centre, but it’d happened so fast.”

He also tried to overheard the police officers, but they didn’t discuss anything new.

On the road, there were wheel tracks as if they’d driven away in a haste. Next to them, Henry saw blood stains scattered around. One of the stains was smeared along the road. Was that his blood? That seemed obvious, but a part of him still didn’t want to accept his death. He tried to think about the people that would like to have him killed, but none came to his mind.

He wanted to follow the stain, but it ended a few meters further. After flying up to check the neighborhood for clues, his eyes fixed on a broken sign. This wasn’t surprising, except that after sign vandalism or accidental breaks, the signs are taken soon after. Unless it happened like an hour ago. Henry got closer to that place and had his suspicions confirmed. They were in such haste, they’d broken the sign.

After a closer inspection, he saw a red paint on a metal part of the sign. The red paint was common, so such clue was useless. But at least two parts, front and side, from their car were damaged, and that could narrow the search.

“How is it going?”

He turned around to find the voice’s source, but couldn’t find anyone. A hope to be visible for anyone faded away.

“Who are you? And where are you?”

“You can’t see me. I’ve only wanted to check if everything is going smoothly. There’s a lot of bureaucracy to do after you're back.”

“Bureaucracy? Why should that bother me?”

“If you finish faster, I’m going to finish faster.” 

Henry was flying around the sign, and thought out loud, more to himself then to omniscent voice.

“They’d driven to the city. Their car’s damaged but even so… it’ll be cumbersome task to find them. And I’m in their trunk.”

“Oh, that really sounds cumbersome… Hopefully, you’ll find them quickly. You’re running out of time.”

Surprised, Henry stopped in place and looked up.

“—running out of time?”

“Yes, I think I forgot to tell you. If you won't find yourself in a one day, you'll stay in this ghost form wandering forever.”

“It's kinda important, you know.”

“Oh maybe it is. Okay, good luck!”

“Wait!” shouted Henry, but no one listened anymore. 

He decided to go to his flat and look for any clues, as he rushed from it that morning. Maybe there would be anything useful there. 

Surprisingly, his apartment was in complete disorder. Someone plundered it looking for something specific. Why would anyone care about him? There was nothing anyone would want to steal. Except the pen drive, that his boss gave to him. He flew to the drawer which was wide open. 

It was gone. The robbers looked for that. He didn't know what the pen drive hold. His heart, if he would have a heart, skipped a beat. His boss deliberately gave him dangerous hardware. He flew straight from the flat.

The office didn't look spectacular. A cube with glasses all around it. Swarms of people wandered near the entrance, walking in groups, probably heading out for a lunch. 

In that building, there was no receptionist. Instead, a guard sat at reception desk, recording the names of everyone who wanted to visit any of the floors. As this was not a blocker for Henry anymore, he flew past them straight to an elevator.  

One thing he immediately noticed when going into the elevator with young blonde woman, was no reflection of his in the mirror. That was understandable as he was a ghost, but it surprised him nonetheless.

His company resided on the fifth floor. Not bothering with the rest of employees, he rushed directly to the boss's office. A faint conversation could be overheard when standing near the door. 

“I didn't mean to have him killed,” said his boss.

“I don't care, you said it'll be easy. You give him the pen drive with codes, we rob him, and get the codes without any suspicions.” That voice sounds strange to Henry. 

What are the codes? He didn't know anything about any codes. There was no simple explanation that could justify giving the pen drive to him. 

“I just pick him by random.”

“And we just killed him on purpose. We couldn't find the codes, and we'd assumed that he had them on him.”

He wanted to get angry. They used him like a cardboard box, easy to recycle after use. But that wasn't the correct time. Not that he could do anything to them. He decided to focus on finding himself. 

“So, what did you to him? ” 

“My boys bumped into him and packed him to a trunk.”

“And?”

“And you know—a trash.”

Henry’s heart sunk. Being dumped into trash was the last thing he would expect. There were much more sophisticated ways of disposing of a body that came to his mind. When he was still living, crime series were something that he'd liked. Melting in the bathtub, cutting his body into pieces, or even digging his body in a forest. But trash? That made him really upset. He flew in front of his boss, tightened his hand, and tried to punch him. Like he expected, his punch passed through the head without a hit. He was a ghost who couldn't touch the mortal world.

“You just threw the body into a thrash? Are you insane?”

Henry stood so close to his boss that saliva would have fallen on his face. Fortunately, it just passed through him. 

“Where was it? I don't want to wander around that place for a while.”

“You remember the café where we held our meetings at the beginning? The one at Backer Street?”

“Oh ye…”

The rest of the conversation was irrelevant to Henry, so he headed out to the place where his body could have been. It wasn't far away. The guy his boss talked to was most likely not a genius, as the place was just a few streets away. 

Cafe Binua was placed on the corner of Baker street. A lot of people were drinking coffee, talking, and smiling cheerfully. They didn't know the horror that lay in the dark alley near the entrance,

There it was. His body tangled and twisted in the most complicated ways. It was unimaginable that someone could be so devastated after being hit by a car. By that moment, the blood on his best clothes had already dried.

When his hand touched his dead body's cheek, he was transferred into it. The darkness engulfed his mind, all the consciousness leaving him.
