The journal Mike started recently helped him a lot with the mental issues he had. Speaking on the phone was therapeutic in a lot of ways. 

The only thing he couldn't pass through was grieving for his dad. People say that such a wound can only be cured with time. In his case, it didn't. It was as painful as in the beginning. 

Everything reminded him of dad, starting with the still-not-cleaned room and finishing with the silver watch on the desk, left intact. 

It was a dark September night, and Mike was at his usual place at home, watching the stars. The sky was clear. It was perfect weather to watch the falling stars. 

He didn't believe in such things. In fact, at that moment, he didn't believe in anything. Many stars were falling without Mark's wish. As soon as the rain of meteorites was about to finish, he sent the only wish he had.

The next day, Mark wanted to make breakfast when a voice made him stop. 

“What are you doing today, Mark?”

It was his dad. Talking and walking, not dead. He couldn't believe that, after all, the wish had come true. Mark hugged his dad the best he could, noticing the silver watch on his right hand. 

“… dear journal, The wish came true. I didn't believe it, but it happened. My dad is alive. I will always pray to the heavens for such an opportunity. I swear, I will never again let him down. Never…”

Mark wanted to talk with dad about today's day at school. He rushed to his dad's room, only to see Mark's phone and the silver watch next to it.
