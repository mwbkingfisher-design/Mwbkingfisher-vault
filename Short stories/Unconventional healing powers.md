It had always started the same way. Me, John, and Kate were driving through the crowded streets of Cracow. The ambulance we drove was always the same. Scratches here and there from squeezing through tight streets in the old city.  
John was hasting to our hospital, avoiding all the cars on the way. Me and Kate performed the resuscitation of a middle-aged man who suffered a heart attack. He almost left that world, and we tried the best we could to help him. 
“Keith, we won’t save him normally,” said Kate. “You need to do your magic.”  
“I’m afraid that I will kill him beforehand.”  
“That’s our last chance. Either that, or he will be gone anyway.”  
I knew she was right. The problem was that I needed to do something in order to do my ‘magic’. But without it, our patient won’t survive until we arrive at the hospital. It was still a long way.  
“I’m really afraid of pathologists. If I’ll do it and he dies, they will investigate the situation, and I could be imprisoned.” I said it hesitantly.  
“This… I know." She sighed heavily. “This is your decision, after all. I’m just saying that he is dead without it.” Kate checked the man’s breathing.   
The punch went smoothly. I hit the man straight in the nose. Whatever breath he tried to take, now there was nothing. The heart was still pumping blood, thanks to the machines we had in the ambulance. Kate closed her eyes. She always did it, but as always, I could see that she looked through her fingers.  
I focused, and the green light moved from the palm of my open hand—the same that punched the man. Those were the two conditions. First, hit the person to be healed as strongly as you can; second, heal him with the punching hand. We came up with that after a lot of research. One of the additions to that was that the person who healed totally forgot what happened. We could work undercover.   
The man opened his eyes, and his breathing stabilized.   
“What happened?” he asked.  
“You had a heart attack, but we stabilized your condition. Unfortunately, when you felt it, you'd hit the wall with your nose.” I said. “But everything will be fine now.”
