Nel and Sally were flying for a long time. Or at least that's what Nel thought because of flying. She wasn't used to doing this, so the time passed differently.

The sudden stop of Sally's talking made her curious about what happened. 

"Why did you stop talking?" asked Nel.

"I think I saw something." Sally was looking around nervously. "Dark thing behind that tree."

The moment she said that three black animals appeared in front of them. They looked scary. Nel saw bones in their wings. One thing she found funny about them, was their snouts, which looked like pig faces. The irresistible laugh was soon stopped by one of the animals spreading its wings. The shapes squeaked so terrifyingly that Nel and Sally shuddered.

"The bats. Follow me, quick!" Sally shouted. Nel was still trembling, not hearing anything. "Nel!"

The last cry out reached her ears. She hurried towards Sally, leaving bats behind. Looking behind her, only to see enemies a few centimeters away, wasn't a great idea.

One of the bats almost reached her with a wing, but Sally sprayed a magic dust in the creature's eyes, slowing it down.
That gave them some time, but it shouldn't be a long time until the bats could follow them at full speed. They were fast, but bats were significantly faster. 

"Why didn't you spray him stronger?" asked Nel.

"Because my power has limits. If only I could have golden wings, these bats wouldn't be a problem." Sally sighed heavily. "But for now, we need to hide. I think I can see a cave ahead of us. Let's fly there."

The cave was just a few meters away. Small entrance hidden behind a wall of trees. Nel turned around her head to see that bats were almost shaken off from the dust. But a few moments later, they were in the cave. Sally led Nel to the bushes near the entrance to hide. Once they were safe, the shapes flashed in their eyes, flying somewhere in the forest.

"We are safe." said Nel. She started to fly away from their hidden spot when Sally stopped Nel.

"What?" asked.

"We are in the bats queen lair. This is her favorite place to sleep." Sally turned head, not wanting to look at Nel.

"Whaaat?" Her eyes opened wide, almost falling out from the eyeballs. "So there are probably thousands of bats here."

"No, there aren't." said Sally with confidence written on her face. "The queen likes peace, so she even doesn't like when someone is guarding her."

"Well, okay… I'll trust you. "

Sally and Nel moved into the darkness of the cave. It was inviting and calm. But in the some time Nel didn't want to go there. She wanted to stay near the calming lights of the forest.
