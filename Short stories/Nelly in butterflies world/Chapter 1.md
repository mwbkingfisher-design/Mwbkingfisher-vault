"I want to see a butterfly~~.~~==,==" ~~Shouted~~==shouted== a little girl~~,~~ standing at the park entrance. "Daddy==,== come."

It was a beautiful summer evening~~. The~~==—the== time of year when ==the== grass was the greenest. Flowers were already blooming, inviting all flying insects. Nel loved looking at them, especially~~, at~~ swallowtail butterflies. She considered them beautiful and could run with them all day.

"I'm coming ~~Nel~~, ~~how~~==Nel. How== do you have so much energy~~.~~==?==" ~~Said~~==said== Michael with a ~~childish~~==childlike== tone of voice.

The child started ~~going~~==walking== into the park, ~~to the place where they usually went. It was~~ ==heading toward their usual spot—==a place full of flowers~~, so~~ ==where== butterflies ~~were~~ happily ~~flying there~~==fluttered==. She ran so quickly that Michael ~~was wondering~~==wondered== when she'd learned to run this fast.

~~They were walking when~~==As== they~~'d~~ ==walked, they== passed a black dog.

"Look ~~dad~~, ==Dad! A== dog." She ~~got~~==moved== closer to the dog.

Michael was about ~~stopping~~==to stop== her, but both the dog and Nel were having fun. He decided not to intervene. ==Instead,== Michael ~~chit-~~chatted with the ~~owner of a~~ dog==’s owner==. It wasn't ~~a~~ long ~~time until~~==before== Nel ~~was~~==grew== bored ~~with~~==of== cuddling.

The ==flower== field ~~of flowers~~ was beautiful ~~with~~==, bathed in the== summer evening sun. Many children ~~were running there~~==ran== and ~~laughing~~==laughed there==. ~~What could be seen at the~~==At== first glance ~~were~~==,== bees ~~flying~~==buzzed== everywhere~~. Little~~==—little== yellow dots in the air, trying to ~~get~~==gather== as much ==nectar as== they could from the blooming flowers.

But what ~~was exceptional in that place~~==stood out most== were the butterflies==—particularly==, ~~and to be precise, swallowtail ones~~==the swallowtails==. Nel ~~just~~ stood in the center of the meadow, ~~and one particularly~~==a== stubborn butterfly ~~was~~ sitting ~~in~~==on== her ==hand== and ==then== flying ~~again~~==away==. Her ~~laugh~~==laughter== echoed ~~everywhere~~==across the scene==. Every childish scream ~~provoked butterfly~~==seemed== to ==make the butterfly== run away, ~~just~~==only== to sit there a few moments later.

"Oh, this one really liked you==,== Nel~~.~~==,==" Michael commented, ~~looking at this picture. In~~==observing== the ~~meantime, he'd~~==scene. He== thought ~~that~~ he saw a butterfly without a wing, but after a ~~while~~==moment,== he was sure ~~that~~ it ~~was an~~==had been his== imagination ~~playing tricks on him~~.

Suddenly, out of the blue, ~~some weird~~==a strange== powder ~~started~~==began== to fall on Nel. ~~Michael knew~~==Knowing== about Nel's allergy, ~~so he approached with a plan~~==Michael moved== to take her away ~~for a moment~~.

He didn't make it ~~on~~==in== time. With ~~every~~==each== step he took, Nel ~~was becoming~~==seemed to shrink== smaller ==and smaller==. It ~~was~~==felt== like a ~~bad dream, and~~ ==nightmare—==he couldn't let her disappear. A few moments later, she was gone. Michael kneeled down and ~~started~~==began== to sob.

---

Nel ~~didn't know~~==had no idea== what was happening around her. In a second, she ~~appeared to be~~==found herself== in a forest ~~full of~~==filled with== trees~~. These trees were~~ made ~~only from single~~==solely of== long leaves. Among them, ~~there were~~ huge rocks as tall as ~~her~~==she were scattered==, ~~looking like~~==resembling== mountains. She~~'d~~ ==had== only seen mountains ~~multiple times on a trip~~==in pictures during trips== with ~~mom and dad~~==her parents==.

"Dad, do you see it?" ~~Asked Nel~~==she asked==, but ~~she didn't see~~ Michael ~~anywhere~~==was nowhere to be seen==. Suddenly, she saw a giant~~, looking~~ ==figure that looked== exactly like her dad.

"Dad~~, dad. Here~~! ==Dad! Over here!=="

Michael didn't turn ~~in~~==toward== her ~~way~~, as if her voice couldn't reach him at all. She tried ~~running~~ to ==run toward== him, but she wasn't getting any closer. Suddenly, Michael ran ~~away from Nel's~~==out of her== sight, nervously looking ==around== for someone ==else==. ~~Not being able talking~~==Feeling hopeless and unable== to ==talk to== her dad, Nel ~~felt hopeless and started~~==began== to sob.

"Hey, little ~~child~~==one==. I'm glad you're here~~.~~==,==" ~~A~~==a== distant voice ~~resonated in Nel's ears, straight~~==echoed== from ~~up~~ above ~~her~~. ~~She~~==Nel== looked up and was surprised ~~by~~==to see== a butterfly ~~with a~~==the== size of herself, flying in the sky.

"Who are you?" ~~These were~~==was== the first ~~words that~~==question== Nel ~~could mutter~~==managed to ask==. Then ~~asked.~~==she added,== "Are you ==a== butterfly? Why ==are== you so big? Can ~~butterfly~~==butterflies== speak?"~~.~~ Many questions ~~were coming~~==spilled== from ~~Nel's~~==her== mouth, but ==the== butterfly stopped her.

"I'm Sally~~,~~==.== I'll answer all ~~of~~ your questions later. We don't have ~~a~~==much== time ~~to lose~~, and you… ~~You~~==you== are the help we ~~were~~==’ve been== looking for."

"Me? I ==just== want ~~only~~ my dad~~." With this words~~,=="== Nel ~~started looking around~~==said, beginning== to ~~find her dad~~==scan the surroundings again==.

"Don't worry~~, you will come back to him~~==. You'll be== safe and ~~sound~~==return to him== soon~~.~~==,==" ~~Butterfly ensured the girl~~==Sally assured her==. "~~Please~~==Just== think ~~it's a~~==of this as== play==,== and ~~after it~~==afterwards==, you ~~will~~=='ll== be back."

"O-okay~~, so~~==. So== what ~~we~~ will ~~be doing~~==we do==?" ~~Asked~~ Nel ==asked, feeling== a bit more convinced. She was still scared, but what could go wrong ~~here~~==with butterflies==? ~~These~~==They== were ~~butterflies. Cute~~==cute== little creatures ~~that Nel was~~==she’d been== playing with ~~every day recently~~==lately==.

"First, I want you to meet someone~~.~~==,==" Sally said cheerfully.

"Oh, who's that?"

"You'll see. Fly with me now." ~~Saying~~==With== that, Sally started flying away.

"Wait! Fly? I can't fly~~.~~==,==" Nel ~~saddened~~==said sadly, worried== that Sally ~~would run away,~~==might leave her forever== and she ~~would~~==’d== never see Michael again.

"You were ~~gifted with~~==given== butterfly magic powder. Think about flying, and it should happen. It's as ~~easy~~==simple== as ~~it sounds~~==that==. Try~~.~~==,==" ~~Explained~~ Sally ==explained==.

Nel tensed ~~and thought about~~==, imagining herself== flying. At first, nothing happened==. Then==, ~~but in~~==after== a ~~few moments~~==moment==, she ~~started levitating~~==began to levitate== a few centimeters above the ground. ~~Slowly~~==Carefully and slowly==, ~~carefully, She flew~~==she rose== higher and higher until she floated next to Sally.

"You see~~,~~==?== I told you it's ==just like nectar for== a ~~piece of~~ flower ~~nectar.~~==,==" ~~Laughed~~ Sally ==laughed==. This ~~sentence~~ made Nel laugh==,== too. "Let's fly now. Follow me." ~~With these words,~~ Sally led ~~their flight~~==her== through ==groves of== single ~~leave~~==-leaf== trees~~,~~ and ~~different species of~~==various== flowers~~. All were looking~~==, all== familiar to Nel. ~~She was looking at everything with amazement~~==Everything looked astonishingly beautiful through her eyes==. Between ==the== trees and flowers, she saw different ~~animals, but~~ ==creatures—==most of them ~~were not recognizable~~==unrecognizable==. There was a giant ~~airplane~~==spider== on long, hairy legs, ~~as well as~~==and== a red ~~truck~~==ladybug== with black ~~dots~~==spots==. Nel ~~would say these are~~==thought they were a== spider and ==a== ladybird, but they ~~had the wrong size~~==were much larger than normal==.

"We're almost there~~.~~==,==" ~~Said~~ Sally ==said==.

They ~~were reaching a place~~==approached an area bursting== with the ~~highest amount of~~==most== flowers ~~that~~ Nel had ever seen ~~in her life~~. ~~A lot of shapes were dancing~~==Shapes danced== around ~~these flowers~~==the blossoms==.

"What are ~~these~~==those==?" Nel ==asked.

"That's my family. I'll introduce you."

~~Nel and Sally~~==They== flew to the largest ~~blossom,~~ ==bloom—==the biggest rose of them all. ~~On~~==Perched on== top ~~of it sat~~==was== a butterfly ~~even~~ more beautiful than Sally. It had ~~beautiful~~ golden wings with ~~a~~ red dots scattered ~~everywhere~~==across them==.

"Nel, meet Dara, our queen and mother of us all. My brothers and sisters are flying around you."

 ~~

Before everything else,~~ Nel ~~looked~~==gazed== at the queen. She felt shy ==but also warm== in her presence~~, but yet she felt her mum warm~~. Something inside ~~was telling that~~==told her== this beautiful creature was harmless.

"Good morning~~.~~==,==" ~~Said~~ Nel ==greeted== immediately, ~~just like~~==as== her parents ==had== taught her. In the next moment, she looked around ~~her~~ to see hundreds of ~~flying~~ butterflies~~. Each one of those wasn't less~~==, each more== beautiful than Sally. She gasped ~~seeing this view~~==at the sight==.

"Hello, my child~~.~~==,==" ~~Answered~~ the queen ==responded==. "I'm Dara==,== and I feel ~~that~~ you can help us with our problem." She ~~glanced~~==looked== at Nel gently.

"Me? Help?" ~~She~~==Nel== couldn't believe ~~how~~ she ~~can help~~==could be of assistance==. "O-okay. What can I do?"~~.~~ 

"In recent times, butterflies ~~got one more~~==have gained an additional== pair of golden magic wings~~,~~ ==—==like mine~~,~~ ==—==that can be worn by any of my kind~~.~~==,==" ~~The~~==the== queen ~~started flapping~~==explained. She flapped== her wings vigorously ~~and~~==, then== suddenly stopped. "But the~~se~~ bats… ~~They~~==they== always ~~tried~~==try== to steal our precious treasure. ~~Unfortunately,~~==And== they ~~succeeded to do it~~==’ve== finally ==succeeded==."

Nel could see the sadness in ~~queen'~~==Dara’==s eyes. "Without the wings, we ~~are unable of migrating~~==can't migrate== when the nectar ~~ends because butterflies~~==runs out. Butterflies== need two leaders to ~~be led~~==guide them==." ~~Dara made a pause before moving forward.~~==The queen paused, then added,== "Please~~,~~ help Sally ~~retrieving~~==retrieve== the magic wings. ~~Now~~==Go now==, ~~go, be back~~==and return== soon." With ~~these words the queen started~~==that, Dara began== preparing ~~going~~ to ~~the nectar~~==depart== with ==a== few butterflies ~~that were~~==,== hurrying her ~~up~~==along==.

"Let's ~~move~~==go== to the ~~core of the~~ park==’s center==, ~~and~~ ==" Sally said once they were alone. "==I ~~will briefly~~==’ll== tell you more." ~~Said Sally when they'd been left alone.~~

Nel ~~raised up~~==moved away== from the rose and flew to Sally. "Okay, which way ==are== we~~'re going~~ ==heading==?"

Sally ~~was leading~~==led== the way, speaking ==as they flew==. "Bats are ~~really~~ vicious ~~creatures~~. ~~If~~==When== they want something, they'll do anything to get it ~~this way or another~~==—by any means==. ~~And so they got~~==They stole== our wings~~. We really~~==, and we== need them back."

 ~~She became silent and they just flew forward.

Nel with a bit of hesitance asked. "But why they're doing this to you. What they want to achieve with it?"

"~~They ~~are~~==flew past== many ~~reasons for it, but the most likely one is to fix us in one place to attack."

Flying, they were passing many of places and things that Nel had never seen in her life. Huge~~==unfamiliar sights—huge== wooden mountains ~~shaded their heads occasionally. Many~~==casting shadows, strange== creatures happily ~~hung around~~==crawling== on the ground. Nel thought she saw an ant, but it was much larger than ~~normal~~==usual==.
