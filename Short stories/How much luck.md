The reason Henry became a paid killer was his ability to see if he could kill someone or not. It was really obvious after getting used to it.

It contained all the information regarding the luck in potential places, the luck in different escape plans, and basically everything that the paid killer would need on his way to the goal.

He was on the roof of the three-story building, aiming the sniper rifle at the target. Henry didn't have, and actually didn't need information about the mission goal, except for some walking patterns and behavior. At that moment, it was young blonde woman. He was aiming for her head.

The table showed his luck to be eight percent for shooting and ninety percent for escaping. The lady's luck was nearly zero. 

“Let's shoot.” muttered Henry. 

Just before triggering the shot, he looked at the table. His luck was cracking down. It was near-zero now, and the girl's luck, on the other hand, was hitting the stars.
