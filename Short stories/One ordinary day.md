Prompt:  
One ordinary day, all people on the planet simultaneously lost their memory. You are the one who knows what happened.

Story:  
I’d always known about my uniqueness. All the people I knew had their plans and executed them more or less perfectly, but I always struggled with even mundane tasks. There was always something in the back of my mind that took the attention from everything else. The conviction that I was made for something bigger than all this.

It wasn’t until a few days ago that I finally found out what it was. The day was bright, like most of them in a summer. Only the red point in the distance drove my attention. What’s more. It seemed that nobody else saw that. It wasn’t a long time when the point became the size of a cloud. That cloud terrified me with eyes and a mouth stuck out of it. Still, nobody noticed it.

“You are the one then,” the cloud said. There was an earthquake when it spoke.

“What’s going on? What—Who are you?” I asked.

“I am The Resetter. Who I was before... that is not important right now.”

“The resetter?”

“Yes,” it paused for a moment.

I was terrified by the look of the cloud, but I wasn’t anxious about the situation. Maybe the shock took over. 

“If you see me, I think I can tell you. You see, the worlds work in cycles. After enough time passes, one of the resetters appears to reset a world.”

“Wait… worlds? Reset?”

“Ha, I knew there would be a lot of questions. I had them myself. But it gets easier with time.”

I looked around and was surprised that nobody could see that monstrosity.

“Don’t be so surprised. They are in the state of resetting. They won’t remember anything from today. They are going to start tomorrow anew.” The cloud spread smokey substance from its mouth. 

“There are multitudes of worlds in this universe. They have only one thing in common. Need of resetting. Without it, everything would be broken. The reset cleanses the world.”

“Let's assume I believe you. Why I'm not in the state of reset?”

“That is on purpose. You are about to become The Resetter. Becoming an omnious and immortal being is something you can be proud of.”

“But I don't want...” I didn't even know what I should do. I’d got a feeling that my fate was already decided and that there's no hideout from that creature.

“Now, with that world reset, let's begin your transformation,” announced the deep voice. 

The streaks of black light came from its mouth, and the world around me became dark.
