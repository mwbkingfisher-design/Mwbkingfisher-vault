“That is the problem with these damned giant heads. They do have ways to control us, the mighty and superior race, and make us obey. But why am I even ~~bothered~~==bothering== to tell you this, little critter?”

The dragon raised his head impatiently. A man stood before him in full plate armor ~~with the~~==, wielding a== golden sword raised in the air.

“O delighted creature of knowledge~~.~~==!== I was sent to you because of our problems with giants. They destroy our villages and towns unknowingly~~; just~~==—simply== by walking, they kill our women and children. O mighty ==one==, do you have any idea how to stop them?”

The cave was dark and ancient~~. Only~~==, illuminated only by== the ~~dim light spread~~==faint glow== from the dragon's eyes~~. Enough~~==—just enough== to ~~show~~==reveal== anxiety on the knight's face. A few knights before him had been destroyed in a ~~mere~~ moment. The knight with the golden sword was ~~lucky~~==fortunate== to ~~be allowed~~==have been granted== an audience.

“I don't intervene in the world of mortals. But if you want advice, ~~then~~ I can tell you this~~. If~~==: if== the giants invade~~d~~ your lands~~—~~==,== you=='d== better ~~move out of these lands~~==leave==,” said the dragon ~~and laid~~==, laying== his head on ~~the~~==his== paw.

“There ~~surely is~~==must be== something ~~that~~ we can do!” insisted the knight, ~~moving toward the creature, but as he came~~==stepping== closer==. As he approached==, the ~~head of the~~ dragon ~~moved~~=='s head jerked== violently~~. A~~==, causing the== man ~~withdrew~~==to withdraw==.

Before closing his eyes completely, the dragon said, “You==’d== better run as fast as you can. I ~~don't~~==no longer== want to waste time ~~anymore~~.”

He was ~~almost~~==nearly== at the cave entrance when ~~the~~==a== low ~~voice growled,~~==growl echoed:== “GET HIM, DRAGON!”

The red==,== spiky head moved as ~~quickly~~==swiftly== as lightning, ~~caught~~==seizing== the knight~~,~~ and ~~swallowed~~==swallowing== him in ~~one swift~~==a single== motion.

“Not again, you damned giant head!”

One of the cave walls ~~opened~~==parted== to ~~show the~~==reveal a== huge eye.

“Sleep, my little dragonnie~~, forget~~==. Forget== about that inconvenience.” 

The last ==puff of== smoke ~~came out~~==issued== from the dragon’s nostrils before he ~~fell asleep once again~~==drifted back into sleep==.
