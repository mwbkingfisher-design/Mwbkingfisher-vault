“Fuck, we’ve only got half a day to do this. Hurry!” Marry was shouting the orders to everyone. She was a leader after all. The most experienced of them. 

“There’s no way. We’re prepared, but it’s still not possible.”

They sat in the car, thinking about the plan. It was supposed to be a clean action. Enter, plant the c4, quickly leave, and then wait for the end to happen.

It all started with their organizations, the Dwellers, inventing time travel machines. They didn’t show it to the world because their intention of using it was malicious. 

Recent events shook the world. The enormous asteroid was flying to Earth. Thanks to the advanced technologies, humanity was able to send a crew to destroy it with nuclear bombs. Not exactly destroy, but rather move the asteroid in a different direction.

Marry, Jack, Henry, and Blair had been sent back to destroy humanity hopes. They wanted to destroy Earth by destroying the space base and preventing it from sending nuclear bombs onto the asteroid. They’d prepared for a few months before that event. 

But all that preparation came to nothing in the face of what they stumbled upon after moving to the past. The base increased its security a thousandfold. Marry had a feeling that all the armies and securities of the world gathered in that one place to protect it.

“Our plan can still succeed. They're not expecting us,” said Blair.

“With all that army? I highly doubt it,” whispered Jack.

“Not our base plan. The plan B.”

“Everything’s up to you then.”

Blair was already focusing on her job. She was a highly skilled mathematician responsible for calculating the trajectory of the missile. Jack and Henry were specialists of The Destroying Machine, which could send undetectable missiles able to destroy even the White House.

They began to set up and assemble the machine. Only a few minutes separated them from the event, but all was prepared. Machine stood, hidden from the unwelcome eyes. Blair calculated everything and waited. 

“They’ve begun. Wait for the order.” Marry was trembling. She didn't know if it was from anxiety or relief that everything would be over soon.

In the distant, the rocket launched. It released a lot of smoke, hiding everything in a black curtain of hope. 

It wasn't before the rocket rose high in the sky that Marry commanded her subordinates to proceed.

“Let's begin the show,” she said. 

The Destroying Machine launched a missile. They watched it until it became a small point near another small point. The first explosion wasn't impressive. In fact, it was just a small amount of fire around the point. But what happened after was something that Marry called a terrifying beauty. 

“Thanks guys. It was good to work with you.” The last words hung in the air, swept in a moment by a nuclear wave.
